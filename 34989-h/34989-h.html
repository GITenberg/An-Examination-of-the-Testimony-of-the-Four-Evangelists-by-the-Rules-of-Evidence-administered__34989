In introducing to the notice of the British Public, Mr. Professor
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Greenleaf's</span></span> Harmony of the Four Gospels, the publishers
have much satisfaction in announcing, that it has become
a Standard Work in the United States of America: and its
intrinsic value has induced them to make it known, in the
hope of promoting its circulation, in this country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The spirit of infidelity is far more restless and active on the
other side of the Atlantic, than, happily, it has been in our
highly-favoured land: and, in consequence, it has called forth
some of the most able and powerful minds to correct and
subdue it. Among these advocates of Divine Revelation, the
profound lawyer, Professor Greenleaf, holds a most honourable
and distinguished place; and his work may justly be regarded
as combining sound and practical knowledge with well-directed
zeal and piety. Its character has been very fairly appreciated
in two leading North American journals, from which the following
extracts are made, as indicative of its contents, and also
of the high estimation in which its learned author is deservedly
held in his own country.

EXTRACT OF A NOTICE OF PROFESSOR GREENLEAF ON THE FOUR GOSPELS,
OCTOBER 24, 1846, IN </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">THE NEW YORK OBSERVER.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
The Author is a lawyer, very learned in his profession, acute, critical and used
to raising and meeting practical doubts. Author of a treatise on the law of evidence,
which has already become a classic in the hands of the profession which he adorns,
and teaches in one of the Law Seminaries which do honour to our country in the
eyes of Europe, he brings rare qualifications for the task he assumes. That he
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
should, with the understanding and from the heart, accept the Gospel as the truth,
avow it as his Hope, and seek to discharge a duty to his fellow-men by laying before
them the grounds on which he founds this acceptance and this hope, are cheering
circumstances to the Christian, and present strong appeals to the indifferent.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
To his profession, to the lawyers of the country, however, this work makes a
strong appeal. They are a very secular profession. Their business is almost
wholly conversant with material interests. Their time is absorbed in controversies,
of passion, or of interest. Acute, critical, and disputatious, they apparently present
a field unpropitious for the acceptance of a religion, spiritual, disinterested, and
insisting on perfect holiness. Still, they necessarily need to know and must enforce
the rules of finding truth and justice; the principles for ascertaining truth and dispensing
justice are the great subjects of all their discussions, so far as they are discussions
of any general principle. From this cause it is, that this profession has numbered
among its members, in every age, Christians of great eminence, and in our own day
and country, we cannot turn to the eminent men of this profession in any large
community, without the satisfaction of finding our Faith embraced by those whose
habits of practical as well as speculative investigation render them evidently the
best able to appreciate its claims and to detect any imperfections in its proof.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
So we trust it always may be; and we are assured that the best models of
the mode of investigating matters of legal controversy as the proof of facts, are
writings on the evidences. Paley's treatise and that of Chalmers, on the oral
testimony in favour of Christ's mission, Paley's examination of the writings of the
apostle Paul, are, we are assured, the best models extant for forming the habit of
examining oral and documentary evidence. These are subjects on which it is of vital
importance, in a secular view, that a lawyer's habits should be right: in a spiritual
view the importance is unspeakable. Mr. Greenleaf has doubtless felt this truth,
and has also felt that his position would give to his labours some authority with his
brethren and with the public. He has given himself honourably to the labour,
and spread its results before the world.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
It is long since Infidelity has found its advocates among the truly learned. Among
the guesses and speculations of a small portion of unsanctified medical men, she still
finds now and then a champion. Historians and philosophers have long since
discussed her pretensions. And now from the Jurists and Lawyers, the practical
masters of this kind of investigation, works are appearing, whereby not only an
earnest reception of the Gospel is manifested, but the mode and means of action and of
credit by which all human affairs are governed.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
We lose in respect to our own investigations on this subject by its very sacredness.
We have an idle dread, that it is not open to free investigation: to severe practical
tests. We need to be invited, to be pressed to examine this subject freely. Dr.
Chalmers in one department of this inquiry has led the way. Mr. Greenleaf in
another has also presented an example. And it will not be competent, after these
men have thus investigated and taught the rules and laws of investigation, for any
man who is not willing to arrogate superior claims to learning and ability, to turn
aside superciliously from an examination of the Gospels.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">
Such are our views of this work, which we commend to all: to the legal
profession, from the character of its topics and the rank of its author: to men
desirous of knowledge, in every rank in life, because of its presenting this subject
under such a treatment as every-day practical questions are treated with.
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagev">[pg v]</span><a name="Pgv" id="Pgv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
It does not touch the intrinsic evidences of the Gospel: those which to the
believer are, after all, the highest proofs. But it is to be remembered, that these
are proofs which are not satisfactory until an examination of the outward evidences
has led men to the conviction, that the Gospels cannot be false.

place the titles of these two books together only by way of contrast. They relate,
it is true, to the same general subject; but it is hard to conceive of two works more
unlike in their scope, character, and purpose. The object of the one is to prove,
and of the other to disprove, the Christian religion. The one is the production of
an able and profound lawyer, a man who has grown grey in the halls of justice and
the schools of jurisprudence,—a writer of the highest authority on legal subjects,
whose life has been spent in weighing testimony and sifting evidence, and whose
published opinions on the rules of evidence are received as authoritative in all the
English and American tribunals,—for fourteen years the highly respected colleague
of the late Mr. Justice Story, and now the honoured head of the most distinguished
and prosperous school of English law in the world. The other is the work of a
German professor and speculatist, also profoundly learned in his way,—an ingenious
and erring framer of theories of the most striking character, almost unheard of till his
brain either conceived them or gave them currency, though relating to topics with
which men have been familiar for eighteen centuries,—a subtle controversialist,
whose work, as he himself avows, is deeply tinged with the most strongly marked
peculiarities of the philosophy and theology of his countrymen. We presume the
most ardent admirer of Dr. Strauss will not object to our characterising the two
works as excellent specimens, the one of clear and shrewd English common sense,
the other of German erudition, laborious diligence, and fertility in original
speculation. And if the subject of inquiry were one that involved his own temporal
and immediate interests, and it were necessary to determine which of these two
writers would give the wiser and safer counsel, or the more trustworthy opinion, we
suppose the same person would agree with us in making the choice.
</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the publishers announcing to Professor Greenleaf their
wish to introduce his Harmony to the notice of the British
Public, he with equal promptitude and kindness communicated
to them some important additions to his Introduction, and also
numerous valuable notes, more particularly adapted to the use
of Theological Students. These are now printed for the first
time: and at the suggestion of a very eminent and learned

The subject of the following work I hope will not be
deemed so foreign to our professional pursuits, as to render it
improper for me to dedicate it, as I now respectfully do, to you.
If a close examination of the evidences of Christianity may be
expected of one class of men more than another, it would seem
incumbent on us, who make the law of evidence one of our
peculiar studies. Our profession leads us to explore the mazes
of falsehood, to detect its artifices, to pierce its thickest veils, to
follow and expose its sophistries, to compare the statements of
different witnesses with severity, to discover truth and separate
it from error. Our fellow-men are well aware of this; and
probably they act upon this knowledge more generally, and
with a more profound repose, than we are in the habit of
considering. The influence, too, of the legal profession upon
the community is unquestionably great; conversant, as it daily
is, with all classes and grades of men, in their domestic and
social relations, and in all the affairs of life, from the cradle to
the grave. This influence we are constantly exerting for good
or ill; and hence, to refuse to acquaint ourselves with the
evidences of the Christian religion, or to act as though, having
fully examined, we lightly esteemed them, is to assume an
appalling amount of responsibility.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The things related by the Evangelists are certainly of the
most momentous character, affecting the principles of our
conduct here, and our happiness for ever. The religion of
Jesus Christ aims at nothing less than the utter overthrow of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
all other systems of religion in the world; denouncing them as
inadequate to the wants of man, false in their foundations, and
dangerous in their tendency. It not only solicits the grave
attention of all, to whom its doctrines are presented, but it
demands their cordial belief, as a matter of vital concernment.
These are no ordinary claims; and it seems hardly possible for
a rational being to regard them with even a subdued interest;
much less to treat them with mere indifference and contempt.
If not true, they are little else than the pretensions of a bold
imposture, which, not satisfied with having already enslaved
millions of the human race, seeks to continue its encroachments
upon human liberty, until all nations shall be subjugated under
its iron rule. But if they are well founded and just, they can
be no less than the high requirements of Heaven, addressed by
the voice of God to the reason and understanding of man,
concerning things deeply affecting his relations to his sovereign,
and essential to the formation of his character and of course to
his destiny, both for this life and for the life to come. Such
was the estimate taken of religion, even the religion of pagan
Rome, by one of the greatest lawyers of antiquity, when he
argued that it was either nothing at all, or was everything.

The arrangement of the Gospels by Dr. Robinson was adopted in this
work, it being the latest published in the United States, and by a scholar
of the highest reputation. But by comparing his order with that of Archbishop
Newcome, as shown in contiguous columns in the Table of Contents
and Synopsis of the Harmony, it will be found that they differ only in a
very few unimportant particulars, not at all affecting the general scheme or
structure of the Harmony, or the purposes of this examination. I have,
however, in several places omitted their transposition of the verses of the
text, occurring within the limits of a section; it being more convenient to
insert them in the order in which they were written by the Evangelists.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 1. In examining the evidences of the Christian religion, it
is essential to the discovery of truth that we bring to the
investigation a mind freed, as far as possible, from existing
prejudice and open to conviction. There should be a readiness,
on our part, to investigate with candour, to follow the
truth wherever it may lead us, and to submit, without reserve
or objection, to all the teachings of this religion, if it be found
to be of divine origin. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is no other entrance,”</span> says
Lord Bacon, <span class="tei tei-q">“to the kingdom of man, which is founded in
the sciences, than to the kingdom of heaven, into which no
one can enter but in the character of a little child.”</span><a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> The
docility which true philosophy requires of her disciples is not
a spirit of servility, or the surrender of the reason and judgment
to whatsoever the teacher may inculcate; but it is a
mind free from all pride of opinion, not hostile to the truth
sought for, willing to pursue the inquiry and impartially to
weigh the arguments and evidence, and to acquiesce in the
judgment of right reason. The investigation, moreover, should
be pursued with the serious earnestness which becomes the
greatness of the subject—a subject fraught with such momentous
consequences to man. It should be pursued as in the presence
of God, and under the solemn sanctions created by a lively
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sense of his omniscience, and of our accountability to him for
the right use of the faculties which he has bestowed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 2. In requiring this candour and simplicity of mind in those
who would investigate the truth of our religion, Christianity
demands nothing more than is readily conceded to every branch
of human science. All these have their data, and their axioms;
and Christianity, too, has her first principles, the admission of
which is essential to any real progress in knowledge. <span class="tei tei-q">“Christianity,”</span>
says Bishop Wilson, <span class="tei tei-q">“inscribes on the portal of her
dominions, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God
as a little child, shall in nowise enter therein.’</span> Christianity
does not profess to convince the perverse and headstrong, to
bring irresistible evidence to the daring and profane, to vanquish
the proud scorner, and afford evidences from which the careless
and perverse cannot possibly escape. This might go to destroy
man's responsibility. All that Christianity professes, is to
propose such evidences as may satisfy the meek, the tractable,
the candid, the serious inquirer.”</span><a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 3. The present design, however, is not to enter upon any
general examination of the evidences of Christianity, but to
confine the inquiry to the testimony of the Four Evangelists,
bringing their narratives to the tests to which other evidence is
subjected in human tribunals. The foundation of our religion
is a basis of fact—the fact of the birth, ministry, miracles,
death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ. These are
related by the Evangelists as having actually occurred, within
their own personal knowledge. Our religion, then, rests on the
credit due to these witnesses. Are they worthy of implicit
belief, in the matters which they relate? This is the question,
in all human tribunals, in regard to persons testifying before
them; and we propose to test the veracity of these witnesses, by
the same rules and means which are there employed. The
importance of the facts testified, and their relations to the affairs
of the soul, and the life to come, can make no difference in the
principles or the mode of weighing the evidence. It is still the
evidence of matters of fact, capable of being seen and known
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and related, as well by one man as by another. And if the
testimony of the Evangelist, supposing it to be relevant and
material to the issue in a question of property or of personal
right, between man and man, in a court of justice, ought to be
believed and have weight; then, upon the like principles, it
ought to receive our entire credit here. But if, on the other
hand, we should be justified in rejecting it, if there testified on
oath, then, supposing our rules of evidence to be sound, we may
be excused if we hesitate elsewhere to give it credence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 4. The proof that God has revealed himself to man by
special and express communications, and that Christianity
constitutes that revelation, is no part of these inquiries. This
has already been shown, in the most satisfactory manner, by
others, who have written expressly upon this subject.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> Referring
therefore to their writings for the arguments and proofs, the
fact will here be assumed as true. That man is a religious
being, is universally conceded, for it has been seen to be
universally true. He is everywhere a worshipper. In every
age and country, and in every stage, from the highest intellectual
culture to the darkest stupidity, he bows with homage
to a superior Being. Be it the rude-carved idol of his own
fabrication, or the unseen divinity that stirs within him, it
is still the object of his adoration. This trait in the character
of man is so uniform, that it may safely be assumed, either
as one of the original attributes of his nature, or as necessarily
resulting from the action of one or more of those attributes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 5. The object of man's worship, whatever it be, will naturally
be his standard of perfection. He clothes it with every
attribute, belonging, in his view, to a perfect character; and
this character he himself endeavours to attain. He may not,
directly and consciously, aim to acquire every virtue of his
deity, and to avoid the opposite vices; but still this will be the
inevitable consequence of sincere and constant worship. As
in human society men become assimilated, both in manners
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and in moral principles, to their chosen associates, so in the
worship of whatever deity men adore, they <span class="tei tei-q">“form to his the
relish of their souls.”</span> To suppose, then, that God made man
capable of religion, and requiring it in order to the development
of the highest part of his nature, without communicating with
him, as a father, in those revelations which alone could perfect
that nature, would be a reproach upon God, and a contradiction.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 6. How it came to pass that man, originally taught, as
we doubt not he was, to know and to worship the true Jehovah,
is found, at so early a period of his history, a worshipper
of baser objects, it is foreign to our present purpose to inquire.
But the fact is lamentably true, that he soon became
an idolater, a worshipper of moral abominations. The
Scythians and Northmen adored the impersonations of heroic
valour and of bloodthirsty and cruel revenge. The mythology
of Greece and of Rome, though it exhibited a few examples
of virtue and goodness, abounded in others of gross licentiousness
and vice. The gods of Egypt were reptiles, and
beasts and birds. The religion of Central and Eastern Asia
was polluted with lust and cruelty, and smeared with blood,
rioting, in deadly triumph, over all the tender affections of
the human heart and all the convictions of the human understanding.
Western and Southern Africa and Polynesia are,
to this day, the abodes of frightful idolatry, cannibalism, and
cruelty; and the aborigines of both the Americas are examples
of the depths of superstition to which the human mind may
be debased. In every quarter of the world, however, there is
a striking uniformity seen, in all the features of paganism.
The ruling principle of her religion is terror, and her deity
is lewd and cruel. Whatever of purity the earlier forms of
paganism may have possessed, it is evident from history that it
was of brief duration. Every form, which history has preserved,
grew rapidly and steadily worse and more corrupt,
until the entire heathen world, before the coming of Christ, was
infected with that loathsome leprosy of pollution, described
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with revolting vividness by St. Paul, in the beginning of his
Epistle to the Romans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 7. So general and decided was this proclivity to the worship
of strange gods, that, at the time of the deluge, only one
family remained faithful to Jehovah; and this was a family
which had been favoured with his special revelation. Indeed
it is evident that nothing but a revelation from God could
raise men from the degradation of pagan idolatry, because
nothing else has ever had that effect. If man could achieve
his own freedom from this bondage, he would long since have
been free. But instead of this, the increase of light and civilization
and refinement in the pagan world has but multiplied
the objects of his worship, added voluptuous refinements to its
ritual, and thus increased the number and weight of his
chains. In this respect there is no difference in their moral
condition, between the barbarous Scythian and the learned
Egyptian or Roman of ancient times, nor between the ignorant
African and the polished Hindu of our own day. The only
method, which has been successfully employed to deliver man
from idolatry, is that of presenting to the eye of his soul an
object of worship perfectly holy and pure, directly opposite, in
moral character, to the gods he had formerly adored. He
could not transfer to his deities a better character than he himself
possessed. He must for ever remain enslaved to his idols,
unless a new and pure object of worship were revealed to him,
with a display of superior power sufficient to overcome his
former faith and his present fears, to detach his affections from
grosser objects, and to fix them upon that which alone is worthy.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
This is precisely what God, as stated in the Holy Scriptures,
has done. He rescued one family from idolatry in the Old
World, by the revelation of himself to Noah; he called a
distinct branch of this family to the knowledge of himself, in
the person of Abraham and his sons; He extended this favour
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to a whole nation, through the ministry of Moses; but it was
through that of Jesus Christ alone that it was communicated to
the whole world. In Egypt, by the destruction of all the
objects of the popular worship, God taught the Israelites that
he alone was the self-existent Almighty. At the Red Sea, he
emphatically showed them that He was the Protector and Saviour
of his people. At Sinai, he revealed himself as the righteous
Governor who required implicit obedience for men, and taught
them, by the strongly marked distinctions of the ceremonial
law, that he was a holy Being, of purer eyes than to behold
evil, and that could not look upon iniquity. The demerit of
sin was inculcated by the solemn infliction of death upon every
animal, offered as a propitiatory sacrifice. And when, by this
system of instruction, he had prepared a people to receive the
perfect revelation of the character of God, of the nature of his
worship, and of the way of restoration to his image and favour,
this also was expressly revealed by the mission of his Son.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 8. That the books of the Old Testament, as we now have them,
are genuine; that they existed in the time of our Saviour, and

which it was originally written, that is, without having been
materially corrupted or falsified, either by heretics or Christians;

the contrary is shown.

The genuineness of these writings really admits of as little
doubt, and is susceptible of as ready proof, as that of any
ancient writings whatever. The rule of municipal law on this
subject is familiar, and applies with equal force to all ancient

first in order, in the prosecution of these inquiries, it may, for
the sake of mere convenience, be designated as our first rule.

§ 9. An ancient document, offered in evidence in our courts,
is said to come from the proper repository, when it is found in
the place where, and under the care of persons with whom, such
writings might naturally and reasonably be expected to be
found; for it is this custody which gives authenticity to documents
found within it.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> If they come from such a place, and

The burden of showing them to be false and unworthy of credit,
is devolved on the party who makes that objection. The presumption
of law is the judgment of charity. It presumes that
every man is innocent until he is proven guilty; that everything
has been done fairly and legally, until it is proved to have
been otherwise; and that every document, found in its proper
repository, and not bearing marks of forgery, is genuine. Now
this is precisely the case with the Sacred Writings. They have
been used in the church from time immemorial, and thus are
found in the place where alone they ought to be looked for.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
They come to us, and challenge our reception of them as genuine
writings, precisely as Domesday Book, the Ancient Statutes
of Wales, or any other of the ancient documents which have
recently been published under the British Record Commission,
are received. They are found in familiar use in all the churches
of Christendom, as the sacred books to which all denominations
of Christians refer, as the standard of their faith. There is no
pretence that they were engraven on plates of gold and discovered
in a cave, nor that they were brought from heaven
by angels; but they are received as the plain narratives
and writings of the men whose names they respectively
bear, made public at the time they were written; and though
there are some slight discrepancies among the copies subsequently
made, there is no pretence that the originals were
anywhere corrupted. If it be objected that the originals are
lost, and that copies alone are now produced, the principles of
the municipal law here also afford a satisfactory answer. For
the multiplication of copies was a public fact, in the faithfulness
of which all the Christian community had an interest, and it is
a rule of law, that, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in matters of public and general interest, all
persons must be presumed to be conversant, on the principle that
individuals are presumed to be conversant with their own affairs</span></span>.
Therefore it is that, in such matters, the prevailing current of
assertion is resorted to as evidence, for it is to this that every
member of the community is supposed to be privy.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> The persons,
moreover, who multiplied these copies, may be regarded,
in some manner, as the agents of the Christian public, for
whose use and benefit the copies were made; and on the
ground of the credit due to such agents, and of the public
nature of the facts themselves, the copies thus made are entitled
to an extraordinary degree of confidence, and, as in the case of
official registers and other public books, it is not necessary that
they should be confirmed and sanctioned by the ordinary tests
of truth.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> If any ancient document concerning our public
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rights were lost, copies which had been as universally received
and acted upon as the Four Gospels have been, would have been
received in evidence in any of our courts of justice, without the
slightest hesitation. The entire text of the Corpus Juris Civilis
is received as authority in all the courts of continental Europe,
upon much weaker evidence of its genuineness; for the integrity
of the Sacred Text has been preserved by the jealousy of opposing
sects, beyond any moral possibility of corruption; while
that of the Roman Civil Law has been preserved only by tacit
consent, without the interest of any opposing school, to watch
over and preserve it from alteration.

§ 10. These copies of the Holy Scriptures having thus been
in familiar use in the churches, from the time when the text
was committed to writing; having been watched with vigilance
by so many sects, opposed to each other in doctrine, yet all
appealing to these Scriptures for the correctness of their faith;
and having in all ages, down to this day, been respected as the
authoritative source of all ecclesiastical power and government,
and submitted to, and acted under in regard to so many claims
of right, on the one hand, and so many obligations of duty, on
the other; it is quite erroneous to suppose that the Christian is
bound to offer any further proof of their genuineness or authenticity.

§ 12. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Matthew</span></span>, called also <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Levi</span></span>, was a Jew of Galilee, but
of what city is uncertain. He held the place of publican, or
tax-gatherer, under the Roman government, and his office seems
to have consisted in collecting the taxes within his district, as
well as the duties and customs levied on goods and persons,
passing in and out of his district or province, across the lake of
Genesareth. While engaged in this business, at the office or
usual place of collection, he was required by Jesus to follow
him, as one of his disciples; a command which he immediately
obeyed. Soon afterwards, he appears to have given a great
entertainment to his fellow-publicans and friends, at which
Jesus was present; intending probably both to celebrate his
own change of profession, and to give them an opportunity
to profit by the teaching of his new Master.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> He was constituted
one of the twelve apostles, and constantly attended the
person of Jesus as a faithful follower, until the crucifixion; and
after the ascension of his Master he preached the gospel for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
some time, with the other apostles, in Judea, and afterwards in
Ethiopia, where he died.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He is generally allowed to have written first, of all the evangelists;
but whether in the Hebrew or the Greek language, or
in both, the learned are not agreed, nor is it material to our
purpose to inquire; the genuineness of our present Greek
gospel being sustained by satisfactory evidence.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> The precise

The earlier date, however, is argued with greater force, from
the improbability that the Christians would be left for several
years without a general and authentic history of our Saviour's
ministry; from the evident allusions which it contains to a
state of persecution in the church at the time it was written;
from the titles of sanctity ascribed to Jerusalem, and a higher
veneration testified for the temple than is found in the other
and later evangelists; from the comparative gentleness with
which Herod's character and conduct are dealt with, that bad
prince probably being still in power; and from the frequent
mention of Pilate, as still governor of Judea.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a>

§ 13. That Matthew was himself a native Jew, familiar with
the opinions, ceremonies, and customs of his countrymen; that
he was conversant with the Sacred Writings, and habituated to
their idiom; a man of plain sense, but of little learning, except
what he derived from the Scriptures of the Old Testament;
that he wrote seriously and from conviction, and had, on most
occasions, been present, and attended closely, to the transactions
which he relates, and relates, too, without any view of
applause to himself; are facts which we may consider established
by internal evidence, as strong as the nature of the case
will admit. It is deemed equally well proved, both by internal
evidence and the aid of history, that he wrote for the use of his
countrymen the Jews. Every circumstance is noticed which
might conciliate their belief, and every unnecessary expression
is avoided which might obstruct it. They looked for the Messiah,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the lineage of David, and born in Bethlehem, in the circumstances
of whose life the prophecies should find fulfilment, a
matter, in their estimation, of peculiar value; and to all these

§ 14. Allusion has been already made to his employment as
a collector of taxes and customs; but the subject is too important
to be passed over without further notice. The tribute imposed
by the Romans upon countries conquered by their arms
was enormous. In the time of Pompey, the sums annually
exacted from their Asiatic provinces, of which Judea was one,
amounted to about four millions and a half sterling, or about
twenty-two millions of dollars. These exactions were made in
the usual forms of direct and indirect taxation; the rate of the
customs on merchandise varying from an eighth to a fortieth
part of the value of the commodity; and the tariff including all
the principal articles of the commerce of the East, much of
which, as is well known, still found its way to Italy through
Palestine, as well as by the way of Damascus and of Egypt.
The direct taxes consisted of a capitation-tax and a land-tax,
assessed upon a valuation or census, periodically taken, under
the oath of the individual, with heavy penal sanctions.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> It is
natural to suppose that these taxes were not voluntarily paid,
especially since they were imposed by the conqueror upon a
conquered people, and by a heathen, too, upon the people of the
house of Israel. The increase of taxes has generally been found
to multiply discontents, evasions and frauds on the one hand,
and, on the other, to increase vigilance, suspicion, close scrutiny,
and severity of exaction. The penal code, as revised by Theodosius,
will give us some notion of the difficulties in the way of
the revenue officers, in the earlier times of which we are speaking.
These difficulties must have been increased by the fact
that, at this period, a considerable portion of the commerce of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that part of the world was carried on by the Greeks, whose ingenuity
and want of faith were proverbial. It was to such an
employment and under such circumstances, that Matthew was
educated; an employment which must have made him acquainted
with the Greek language, and extensively conversant with the
public affairs and the men of business of his time; thus entitling
him to our confidence, as an experienced and intelligent observer
of events passing before him. And if the men of that day were,
as in truth they appear to have been, as much disposed as those
of the present time, to evade the payment of public taxes and
duties, and to elude, by all possible means, the vigilance of the
revenue officers, Matthew must have been familiar with a great
variety of the forms of fraud, imposture, cunning, and deception,
and must have become habitually distrustful, scrutinizing, and
cautious; and, of course, much less likely to have been deceived
in regard to many of the facts in our Lord's ministry, extraordinary
as they were, which fell under his observation. This
circumstance shows both the sincerity and the wisdom of Jesus,
in selecting him for an eye-witness of his conduct, and adds
great weight to the value of the testimony of this evangelist.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 15. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mark</span></span> was the son of a pious sister of Barnabas, named
Mary, who dwelt at Jerusalem, and at whose home the early
Christians often assembled. His Hebrew name was John; the
surname of Mark having been adopted, as is supposed, when he
left Judea to preach the gospel in foreign countries; a practice
not unusual among the Jews of that age, who frequently, upon
such occasions, assumed a name more familiar than their own
to the people whom they visited. He is supposed to have been
converted to the Christian faith by the ministry of Peter. He
travelled from Jerusalem to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas,
and afterwards accompanied them elsewhere. When they landed
at Perga in Pamphylia, he left them and returned to Jerusalem;
for which reason, when he afterwards would have gone with
them, Paul refused to take him. Upon this, a difference of
opinion arose between the two apostles, and they separated,
Barnabas taking Mark with him to Cyprus. Subsequently he
accompanied Timothy to Rome, at the express desire of Paul.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
From this city he probably went into Asia, where he found
Peter, with whom he returned to Rome, in which city he is
supposed to have written and published his Gospel. Such is
the outline of his history, as it is furnished by the New Testament.<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>
The early historians add, that after this he went into
Egypt and planted a church in Alexandria, where he died.<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a>

§ 16. It is agreed that Mark wrote his Gospel for the use of
Gentile converts; an opinion deriving great force from the explanations
introduced into it, which would have been useless to
a Jew;<a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22" href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> and that it was composed for those at Rome, is believed,
not only from the numerous Latinisms it contains, but from the
unanimous testimony of ancient writers, and from the internal
evidence afforded by the Gospel itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 17. Some have entertained the opinion that Mark compiled
his account from that of Matthew, of which they supposed
it an abridgment. But this notion has been refuted by Koppe,
and others,<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> and is now generally regarded as untenable. For
Mark frequently deviates from Matthew in the order of time, in
his arrangement of facts; and he adds many things not related
by the other evangelists; neither of which a mere epitomizer
would probably have done. He also omits several things related
by Matthew, and imperfectly describes others, especially the
transactions of Christ with the apostles after the resurrection;
giving no account whatever of his appearance in Galilee; omissions
irreconcilable with any previous knowledge of the Gospel
according to Matthew. To these proofs we may add, that in
several places there are discrepancies between the accounts of
Matthew and Mark, not, indeed, irreconcilable, but sufficient
to destroy the probability that the latter copied from the
former.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> The striking coincidences between them, in style,
words, and things, in other places, may be accounted for by
considering that Peter, who is supposed to have dictated this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Gospel to Mark, was quite as intimately acquainted as Matthew
with the miracles and discourses of our Lord; which, therefore,
he would naturally recite in his preaching; and that the same
things might very naturally be related in the same manner, by
men who sought not after excellency of speech. Peter's agency
in the narrative of Mark is asserted by all ancient writers, and
is confirmed by the fact, that his humility is conspicuous in
every part of it, where anything is or might be related of him;
his weaknesses and fall being fully exposed, while things which
might redound to his honour, are either omitted or but slightly
mentioned; that scarcely any transaction of Jesus is related,
at which Peter was not present, and that all are related with
that circumstantial minuteness which belongs to the testimony
of an eye-witness.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a> We may, therefore, regard the Gospel of
Mark as an original composition, written at the dictation of
Peter, and consequently as another original narrative of the life,
miracles, and doctrines of our Lord.

§ 18. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Luke</span></span>, according to Eusebius, was a native of Antioch,
by profession a physician, and for a considerable period a companion
of the apostle Paul. From the casual notices of him in
the Scriptures, and from the early Christian writers, it has been
collected, that his parents were Gentiles, but that he in his
youth embraced Judaism, from which he was converted to
Christianity. The first mention of him is that he was with Paul
at Troas;<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> whence he appears to have attended him to Jerusalem;
continued with him in all his troubles in Judea; and
sailed with him when he was sent a prisoner from Cæsarea to
Rome, where he remained with him during his two years'
confinement. As none of the ancient fathers have mentioned
his having suffered martyrdom, it is generally supposed that
he died a natural death.

§ 19. That he wrote his Gospel for the benefit of Gentile
converts is affirmed by the unanimous voice of Christian antiquity;
and it may also be inferred from its dedication to
a Gentile. He is particularly careful to specify various circumstances
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conducive to the information of strangers, but not so to
the Jews; he gives the lineage of Jesus upwards, after the
manner of the Gentiles, instead of downwards, as Matthew had
done; tracing it up to Adam, and thus showing that Jesus was
the promised seed of the woman; and he marks the eras of his
birth, and of the ministry of John, by the reigns of the Roman
emperors. He also has introduced several things, not mentioned
by the other evangelists, but highly encouraging to the Gentiles
to turn to God in the hope of pardon and acceptance; of which
description are the parables of the publican and pharisee, in the
temple; the lost piece of silver; and the prodigal son; and the
fact of Christ's visit to Zaccheus the publican, and the pardon
of the penitent thief.

particular and even professional attention to all our Saviour's

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
defective and inaccurate narratives then in circulation, and to
deliver to Theophilus, to whom it is addressed, a full and
authentic account of the life, doctrines, miracles, death and
resurrection of our Saviour. Who Theophilus was, the learned
are not perfectly agreed; but the most probable opinion is that
of Dr. Lardner, now generally adopted, that, as Luke wrote
his Gospel in Greece, Theophilus was a man of rank in that
country.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> Either the relations subsisting between him and

the evangelist, who himself also <span class="tei tei-q">“had perfect understanding
of all things from the first,”</span> to devote the utmost care to the
drawing up of a complete and authentic narrative of these great
events. He does not affirm himself to have been an eye-witness;
though his personal knowledge of some of the transactions may
well be inferred from the <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect understanding”</span> which he
says he possessed. Some of the learned seem to have drawn
this inference as to them all, and to have placed him in the
class of original witnesses; but this opinion, though maintained
on strong and plausible grounds, is not generally adopted. If,
then, he did not write from his own personal knowledge, the
question is, what is the legal character of his testimony?

inquisition, and, as such, would be legally admissible in evidence,
in a court of justice. To entitle such results, however, to our
full confidence, it is not necessary that they should be obtained
under a legal commission; it is sufficient if the inquiry is
gravely undertaken and pursued, by a person of competent
intelligence, sagacity and integrity. The request of a person in
authority, or a desire to serve the public, are, to all moral
intents, as sufficient a motive as a legal commission.<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> Thus,

we know that when complaint is made to the head of a department,
of official misconduct or abuse, existing in some remote
quarter, nothing is more common than to send some confidential
person to the spot, to ascertain the facts and report them to
the department; and this report is confidently adopted as the
basis of its discretionary action, in the correction of the abuse,
or the removal of the offender. Indeed, the result of any
grave inquiry is equally certain to receive our confidence, though
it may have been voluntarily undertaken, if the party making it
had access to the means of complete and satisfactory information
upon the subject.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> If, therefore, Luke's Gospel were to be
regarded only as the work of a contemporary historian, it would
be entitled to our confidence. But it is more than this. It is
the result of careful inquiry and examination, made by a person
of science, intelligence and education, concerning subjects which
he was perfectly competent to investigate, and as to many of
which he was peculiarly skilled, they being cases of the cure of
maladies; subjects, too, of which he already had the perfect
knowledge of a contemporary, and perhaps an eye-witness, but
beyond doubt, familiar with the parties concerned in the transactions,
and belonging to the community in which the events
transpired, which were in the mouths of all; and the narrative,
moreover, drawn up for the especial use, and probably at the
request, of a man of distinction, whom it would not be for the
interest nor safety of the writer to deceive or mislead. Such a
document certainly possesses all the moral attributes of an inquest
of office, or of any other official investigation of facts; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

competent and satisfactory evidence of the matters it contains.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 23. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">John</span></span>, the last of the evangelists, was the son of
Zebedee, a fisherman of the town of Bethsaida, on the sea of
Galilee. His father appears to have been a respectable man
in his calling, owning his vessel and having hired servants.<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>
His mother, too, was among those who followed Jesus and
<span class="tei tei-q">“ministered unto him<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href="#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>;”</span> and to John himself, Jesus, when on
the cross, confided the care and support of his own mother.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>
This disciple also seems to have been favourably known to the
high priest, and to have influence in his family; by means of
which he had the privilege of being present in his palace at
the examination of his Master, and of introducing also Peter,
his friend.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> He was the youngest of the apostles, was eminently
the object of our Lord's regard and confidence; was on
various occasions admitted to free and intimate intercourse
with him; and is described as <span class="tei tei-q">“the disciple whom Jesus loved.”</span><a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>
Hence he was present at several scenes, to which most of the
others were not admitted. He alone, in company with Peter
and James, was present at the resurrection of Jairus's daughter,
at the transfiguration on the mount, and at the agony of our
Saviour in the garden of Gethsemane.<a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> He was the only apostle
who followed Jesus to the cross, he was the first of them at the
sepulchre, and he was present at the several appearances of our
Lord after his resurrection. These circumstances, together with
his intimate friendship with the mother of Jesus, especially
qualify him to give a circumstantial and authentic account of
the life of his Master. After the ascension of Christ, and the
effusion of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, John
became one of the chief apostles of the circumcision, exercising
his ministry in and near Jerusalem. From ecclesiastical history
we learn that, after the death of Mary the mother of Jesus,
he proceeded to Asia Minor, where he founded and presided
over seven churches, in as many cities, but resided chiefly at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Ephesus. Thence he was banished, in Domitian's reign, to the
isle of Patmos, where he wrote his Revelation. On the accession
of Nerva he was freed from exile, and returned to Ephesus,
where he wrote his Gospel and Epistles, and died at the age of
one hundred years, about A.D. 100, in the third year of the
emperor Trajan.<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 24. The learned are not agreed as to the time when the
Gospel of John was written, some dating it as early as the
year 68, others as late as the year 98; but it is generally conceded
to have been written after all the others. That it could
not have been the work of some Platonic Christian of a subsequent
age, as some have without evidence asserted, is manifest
from references to it by some of the early fathers, and from the
concurring testimony of many other writers of the ancient
Christian church.<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href="#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 25. That it was written either with especial reference to
the Gentiles, or at a period when very many of them had
become converts to Christianity, is inferred from the various
explanations it contains, beyond the other Gospels, which could
have been necessary only to persons unacquainted with Jewish
names and customs.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> And that it was written after all the
others, and to supply their omissions, is concluded, not only
from the uniform tradition and belief in the church, but from
his studied omission of most of the transactions noticed by the
others, and from his care to mention several incidents which
they have not recorded. That their narratives were known to
him, is too evident to admit of doubt; while his omission to
repeat what they had already stated, or, where he does mention
the same things, his relating them in a brief and cursory
manner, affords incidental but strong testimony that he regarded
their accounts as faithful and true.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 26. Such are the brief histories of the men, whose narratives
we are to examine and compare; conducting the examination
and weighing the testimony by the same rules and principles
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which govern our tribunals of justice in similar cases. These
tribunals are in such cases governed by the following fundamental
rule:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">In trials of fact, by oral testimony, the proper inquiry is not
whether it is possible that the testimony may be false, but whether
there is sufficient probability that it is true.</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should be observed that the subject of inquiry is matter of
fact, and not of abstract mathematical truth. The latter alone
is susceptible of that high degree of proof, usually termed
demonstration, which excludes the possibility of error, and
which therefore may reasonably be required in support of every
mathematical deduction. But the proof of matters of fact rests
upon moral evidence alone; by which is meant not merely that
species of evidence which is employed in cases respecting moral
conduct, but all the evidence which we do not obtain either
from our own senses, from intuition, or from demonstration.
In the ordinary affairs of life we do not require nor expect
demonstrative evidence, because it is inconsistent with the
nature of matters of fact, and to insist on its production would
be unreasonable and absurd. And it makes no difference,
whether the facts to be proved relate to this life or to the next,
the nature of the evidence required being in both cases the
same. The error of the sceptic consists in pretending or supposing
that there is a difference in the nature of the evidence,
where there is no difference in the nature of the things to be
proved; and in demanding demonstrative evidence concerning
things which are not susceptible of any other than moral evidence
alone, and of which the utmost that can be said is that
there is no reasonable doubt of their truth.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 27. In proceeding to weigh the evidence of any proposition
of fact, the previous question to be determined is, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when</span></em> may it
be said to be proved? The answer to this question is furnished
by another rule of municipal law, which may be thus stated:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">A proposition of fact is proved, when its truth is established by
competent and satisfactory evidence.</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
By competent evidence, is meant such as the nature of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thing to be proved requires; and by satisfactory evidence, is
meant that amount of proof, which ordinarily satisfies an unprejudiced
mind, beyond any reasonable doubt. The circumstances
which will amount to this degree of proof can never be previously
defined; the only legal test to which they can be subjected
is, their sufficiency to satisfy the mind and conscience of
a man of common prudence and discretion, and so to convince
him, that he would venture to act upon that conviction in
matters of the highest concern and importance to his own
interest.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> If, therefore, the subject is a problem in mathematics,
its truth is to be shown by the certainty of demonstrative
evidence. But if it is a question of fact in human
affairs, nothing more than moral evidence can be required, for
this is the best evidence which, from the nature of the case, is
attainable. Now as the facts, stated in Scripture History, are
not of the former kind, but are cognizable by the senses, they
may be said to be proved when they are established by that
kind and degree of evidence which, as we have just observed,
would, in the affairs of human life, satisfy the mind and conscience
of a common man. When we have this degree of
evidence, it is unreasonable to require more. A juror would
violate his oath, if he should refuse to acquit or condemn a
person charged with an offence, where this measure of proof
was adduced.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 28. Proceeding further, to inquire whether the facts related
by the Four Evangelists are proved by competent and satisfactory
evidence, we are led, first, to consider on which side lies
the burden of establishing the credibility of the witnesses.
On this point the municipal law furnishes a rule, which is
of constant application in all trials by jury, and is indeed the
dictate of that charity which thinketh no evil.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This rule serves to show the injustice with which the writers
of the Gospels have ever been treated by infidels; an injustice
silently acquiesced in even by Christians; in requiring the
Christian affirmatively, and by positive evidence, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">aliunde</span></span>, to
establish the credibility of his witnesses above all others, before
their testimony is entitled to be considered, and in permitting
the testimony of a single profane writer, alone and uncorroborated,
to outweigh that of any single Christian. This is
not the course in courts of chancery, where the testimony of a
single witness is never permitted to outweigh the oath even of
the defendant himself, interested as he is in the cause; but, on
the contrary, if the plaintiff, after having required the oath of
his adversary, cannot overthrow it by something more than
the oath of one witness, however credible, it must stand as
evidence against him. But the Christian writer seems, by the
usual course of the argument, to have been deprived of the
common presumption of charity in his favour; and reversing the
ordinary rule of administering justice in human tribunals, his
testimony is unjustly presumed to be false, until it is proved
to be true. This treatment moreover, has been applied to them
all in a body; and, without due regard to the fact, that, being
independent historians, writing at different periods, they are
entitled to the support of each other: they have been treated, in
the argument, almost as if the New Testament were the entire
production, at once, of a body of men, conspiring by a joint
fabrication, to impose a false religion upon the world. It is
time that this injustice should cease, that the testimony of the
evangelists should be admitted to be true, until it can be
disproved by those who would impugn it; that the silence of
one sacred writer on any point, should no more detract from
his own veracity or that of the other historians, than the like
circumstance is permitted to do among profane writers; and
that the Four Evangelists should be admitted in corroboration
of each other, as readily as Josephus and Tacitus, or Polybius
and Livy.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>

§ 29. But if the burden of establishing the credibility of
the evangelists were devolved on those who affirm the truth
of their narratives, it is still capable of a ready moral demonstration,
when we consider the nature and character of the
testimony, and the essential marks of difference between true
narratives of facts and the creations of falsehood. It is universally
admitted that the credit to be given to witnesses depends
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chiefly on their ability to discern and comprehend what was
before them, their opportunities for observation, the degree of
accuracy with which they are accustomed to mark passing
events, and their integrity in relating them. The rule of municipal
law on this subject embraces all these particulars, and is
thus stated by a legal text-writer of the highest repute.

Let the evangelists be tried by these tests.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 30. And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>, as to their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">honesty</span></em>. Here they are entitled to
the benefit of the general course of human experience, that men
ordinarily speak the truth, when they have no prevailing motive
or inducement to the contrary. This presumption, to which we
have before alluded, is applied in courts of justice, even to
witnesses whose integrity is not wholly free from suspicion;
much more is it applicable to the evangelists, whose testimony
went against all their worldly interests. The great truths
which the apostles declared, were, that Christ had risen from
the dead, and that only through repentance from sin, and faith
in him, could men hope for salvation. This doctrine they
asserted with one voice, everywhere, not only under the greatest
discouragements, but in the face of the most appalling terrors
that can be presented to the mind of man. Their master had
recently perished as a malefactor, by the sentence of a public
tribunal. His religion sought to overthrow the religions of the
whole world. The laws of every country were against the
teachings of his disciples. The interests and passions of all the
rulers and great men in the world were against them. The
fashion of the world was against them. Propagating this new
faith, even in the most inoffensive and peaceful manner, they
could expect nothing but contempt, opposition, revilings, bitter
persecutions, stripes, imprisonments, torments and cruel deaths.
Yet this faith they zealously did propagate; and all these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
miseries they endured undismayed, nay, rejoicing. As one
after another was put to a miserable death, the survivors only
prosecuted their work with increased vigour and resolution. The
annals of military warfare afford scarcely an example of the like
heroic constancy, patience and unblenching courage. They
had every possible motive to review carefully the grounds of their
faith, and the evidences of the great facts and truths which
they asserted; and these motives were pressed upon their
attention with the most melancholy and terrific frequency.
It was therefore impossible that they could have persisted in
affirming the truths they have narrated, had not Jesus actually
risen from the dead, and had they not known this fact as
certainly as they knew any other fact.<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href="#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> If it were morally
possible for them to have been deceived in this matter, every
human motive operated to lead them to discover and avow their
error. To have persisted in so gross a falsehood, after it was
known to them, was not only to encounter, for life, all the evils
which man could inflict, from without, but to endure also the
pangs of inward and conscious guilt, with no hope of future
peace, no testimony of a good conscience, no expectation of
honour or esteem among men, no hope of happiness in this life,
or in the world to come.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 31. Such conduct in the apostles would moreover have
been utterly irreconcilable with the fact, that they possessed
the ordinary constitution of our common nature. Yet their
lives do show them to have been men like all others of our
race; swayed by the same motives, animated by the same
hopes, affected by the same joys, subdued by the same sorrows,
agitated by the same fears, and subject to the same passions,
temptations and infirmities, as ourselves. And their writings
show them to have been men of vigorous understandings. If
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then their testimony was not true, there was no possible motive
for its fabrication.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 32. It would also have been irreconcilable with the fact
that they were good men. But it is impossible to read their
writings, and not feel that we are conversing with men eminently
holy, and of tender consciences, with men acting under an
abiding sense of the presence and omniscience of God, and of
their accountability to him, living in his fear, and walking in
his ways. Now, though, in a single instance, a good man may
fall, when under strong temptations, yet he is not found persisting,
for years, in deliberate falsehood, asserted with the
most solemn appeals to God, without the slightest temptation
or motive, and against all the opposing interests which reign in
the human breast. If, on the contrary, they are supposed to
have been bad men, it is incredible that such men should have
chosen this form of imposture; enjoining, as it does, unfeigned
repentance, the utter forsaking and abhorrence of all falsehood
and of every other sin, the practice of daily self-denial, self-abasement
and self-sacrifice, the crucifixion of the flesh with all
its earthly appetites and desires, indifference to the honours,
and hearty contempt of the vanities of the world; and inculcating
perfect purity of heart and life, and intercourse of the
soul with heaven. It is incredible, that bad men should invent
falsehoods, to promote the religion of the God of truth. The
supposition is suicidal. If they did believe in a future state of
retribution, a heaven and a hell hereafter, they took the most
certain course, if false witnesses, to secure the latter for their
portion. And if, still being bad men, they did not believe in
future punishment, how came they to invent falsehoods, the
direct and certain tendency of which was to destroy all their
prospects of worldly honour and happiness, and to ensure their
misery in this life? From these absurdities there is no escape,
but in the perfect conviction and admission that they were
good men, testifying to that which they had carefully observed
and considered, and well knew to be true.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>

§ 33. In the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> place, as to their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ability</span></em>. The text writer
before cited observes, that the ability of a witness to speak
the truth, depends on the opportunities which he has had for
observing the fact, the accuracy of his powers of discerning,
and the faithfulness of his memory in retaining the facts, once
observed and known.<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> Of the latter trait, in these witnesses,
we of course know nothing; nor have we any traditionary
information in regard to the accuracy of their powers of discerning.
But we may well suppose that in these respects they
were like the generality of their countrymen, until the contrary
is shown by an objector. It is always to be presumed that men
are honest, and of sound mind, and of the average and ordinary
degree of intelligence. This is not the judgment of mere
charity; it is also the uniform presumption of the law of the
land; a presumption which is always allowed freely and fully to
operate, until the fact is shown to be otherwise, by the party
who denies the applicability of this presumption to the particular
case in question. Whenever an objection is raised in opposition
to the ordinary presumptions of law, or to the ordinary
experience of mankind, the burden of proof is devolved on the
objector, by the common and ordinary rules of evidence, and of
practice in courts. No lawyer is permitted to argue in disparagement
of the intelligence or integrity of a witness, against
whom the case itself afforded no particle of testimony. This is
sufficient for our purpose, in regard to these witnesses. But
more than this is evident, from the minuteness of their narratives,
and from their history. Matthew was trained, by his
calling, to habits of severe investigation and suspicious scrutiny;
and Luke's profession demanded an exactness of observation
equally close and searching. The other two evangelists, it has
been well remarked, were as much too unlearned to forge the
story of their Master's life, as these were too learned and acute
to be deceived by imposture.

of their testimony. The character of their narratives is
like that of all other true witnesses, containing, as Dr. Paley
observes, substantial truth, under circumstantial variety. There
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is enough of discrepancy to show that there could have been no
previous concert among them; and at the same time such substantial
agreement as to show that they all were independent
narrators of the same great transaction, as the events actually
occurred. That they conspired to impose falsehood upon the
world is, moreover, utterly inconsistent with the supposition
that they were honest men; a fact, to the proofs of which we
have already adverted. But if they were bad men, still the idea
of any conspiracy among them is negatived, not only by the
discrepancies alluded to, but by many other circumstances
which will be mentioned hereafter; from all which, it is manifest
that if they concerted a false story, they sought its accomplishment
by a mode quite the opposite to that which all others are
found to pursue, to attain the same end. On this point the
profound remark of an eminent writer is to our purpose; that
<span class="tei tei-q">“in a number of concurrent testimonies, where there has been
no previous concert, there is a probability distinct from that
which may be termed the sum of the probabilities resulting
from the testimonies of the witnesses, a probability which
would remain, even though the witnesses were of such a character
as to merit no faith at all. This probability arises
from the concurrence itself. That such a concurrence should
spring from chance, is as one to infinite; that is, in other
words, morally impossible. If therefore concert be excluded,
there remains no cause but the reality of the fact.”</span><a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a>

§ 35. The discrepancies between the narratives of the several
evangelists, when carefully examined, will not be found sufficient
to invalidate their testimony. Many seeming contradictions
will prove, upon closer scrutiny, to be in substantial agreement;
and it may be confidently asserted that there are none that
will not yield, under fair and just criticism. If these different
accounts of the same transactions were in strict verbal conformity
with each other, the argument against their credibility
would be much stronger. All that is asked for these witnesses
is, that their testimony may be regarded as we regard the testimony
of men in the ordinary affairs of life. This they are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
justly entitled to; and this no honourable adversary can refuse.
We might, indeed, take higher ground than this, and confidently
claim for them the severest scrutiny; but our present purpose
is merely to try their veracity by the ordinary tests of truth,
admitted in human tribunals.

because of a few discrepancies among them, we shall be
obliged to discard that of many of the contemporaneous histories
on which we are accustomed to rely. Dr. Paley has
noticed the contradiction between Lord Clarendon and Burnett
and others in regard to Lord Strafford's execution; the former
stating that he was condemned to be hanged, which was done
on the same day; and the latter all relating that on a Saturday
he was sentenced to the block, and was beheaded on the following
Monday. Another striking instance of discrepancy has
since occurred, in the narratives of the different members of the
royal family of France, of their flight from Paris to Varennes,
in 1792. These narratives, ten in number, and by eye-witnesses
and personal actors in the transactions they relate,
contradict each other, some on trivial and some on more
essential points, but in every case in a wonderful and inexplicable
manner.<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> Yet these contradictions do not, in the
general public estimation, detract from the integrity of the
narrators, nor from the credibility of their relations. In the
points in which they agree, and which constitute the great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
body of their narratives, their testimony is of course not
doubted; where they differ, we reconcile them as well as we
may; and where this cannot be done at all, we follow that
light which seems to us the clearest. Upon the principles of
the sceptic, we should be bound utterly to disbelieve them all.
On the contrary, we apply to such cases the rules which, in
daily experience, our judges instruct juries to apply, in weighing
and reconciling the testimony of different witnesses; and
which the courts themselves observe, in comparing and reconciling
different and sometimes discordant reports of the same
decisions. This remark applies especially to some alleged
discrepancies in the reports which the several evangelists have
given of the same discourses of our Lord.<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>

§ 37. In the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fourth</span></em> place, as to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conformity of their testimony
with experience</span></em>. The title of the evangelists to full credit
for veracity would be readily conceded by the objector, if the
facts they relate were such as ordinarily occur in human
experience. But they also relate events which were miraculous,
or out of the ordinary course of human experience, and on
this circumstance an argument is founded against their credibility.
Miracles, say the objectors, are impossible; and therefore
the evangelists were either deceivers or deceived; and in
either case their narratives are unworthy of belief. Spinosa's
argument against the possibility of miracles, was founded on
the broad and bold assumption that all things are governed by
immutable laws, or fixed modes of motion and relation, termed
the laws of nature, by which God himself is of necessity bound.
This erroneous assumption is the tortoise, on which stands the
elephant that upholds his system of atheism. He does not
inform us who made these immutable laws, nor whence they
derive their binding force and irresistible operation. The
argument supposes that the creator of all things first made a
code of laws, and then put it out of his own power to change
them. The scheme of Mr. Hume is but another form of the
same error. He deduces the existence of such immutable laws
from the uniform course of human experience. This, he affirms,
is our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; and
whatever is contrary to human experience, he pronounces
incredible.<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href="#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> Without stopping to examine the correctness of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
this doctrine, as a fundamental principle in the law of evidence,
it is sufficient in this place to remark, that is contains this
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fallacy; it excludes all knowledge derived by inference or
deduction from facts, confining us to what we derive from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
experience alone, and thus depriving us of any knowledge,
or even rational belief, of the existence or character of God.
Nay more, it goes to prove that successive generations of men
can make no advancement in knowledge, but each must begin
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de novo</span></span>, and be limited to the results of its own experience.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
But if we may infer, from what we see and know, that there is
a Supreme Being, by whom this world was created, we may
certainly, and with equal reason, believe him capable of works
which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> have never yet known him to perform. We
may fairly conclude that the power which was originally put
forth to create the world is still constantly and without ceasing
exerted to sustain it; and that the experienced connexion
between cause and effect is but the uniform and constantly
active operation of the finger of God. Whether this uniformity
of operation extends to things beyond the limits of our observation,
is a point we cannot certainly know. Its existence in
all things that ordinarily concern us may be supposed to be
ordained as conducive to our happiness; and if the belief in a
revelation of peace and mercy from God is conducive to the
happiness of man, it is not irrational to suppose that he would
depart from his ordinary course of action, in order to give it
such attestations as should tend to secure that belief. <span class="tei tei-q">“A
miracle is improbable, when we can perceive no sufficient
cause, in reference to his creatures, why the Deity should vary
his modes of operation; it ceases to be so, when such cause is
assigned.”</span><a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>

§ 38. But the full discussion of the subject of miracles forms
no part of the present design. Their credibility has been fully
established, and the objections of sceptics most satisfactorily
met and overthrown, by the ablest writers of our own day,
whose works are easily accessible.<a id="noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> Thus much, however, may
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
here be remarked; that in almost every miracle related by the
evangelists, the facts, separately taken, were plain, intelligible,
transpiring in public, and about which no person of ordinary
observation would be likely to mistake. Persons blind or
crippled, who applied to Jesus for relief, were known to have
been crippled or blind for many years; they came to be cured;
he spake to them; they went away whole. Lazarus had been
dead and buried four days; Jesus called him to come forth
from the grave; he immediately came forth, and was seen alive
for a long time afterwards. In every case of healing, the
previous condition of the sufferer was known to all; all saw
his instantaneous restoration, and all witnessed the act of
Jesus in touching him, and heard his words.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> All these,
separately considered, were facts, plain and simple in their
nature, easily seen and fully comprehended by persons of
common capacity and observation. If they were separately
testified to, by different witnesses of ordinary intelligence and
integrity, in any court of justice, the jury would be bound to
believe them; and a verdict, rendered contrary to the uncontradicted
testimony of credible witnesses to any one of these
plain facts, separately taken, would be liable to be set aside, as
a verdict against evidence. If one credible witness testified to
the fact, that Bartimeus was blind, according to the uniform
course of administering justice, this fact would be taken as
satisfactorily proved. So also, if his subsequent restoration to
sight were the sole fact in question, this also would be deemed
established, by the like evidence. Nor would the rule of
evidence be at all different, if the fact to be proved were the
declaration of Jesus, immediately preceding his restoration to
sight, that his faith had made him whole. In each of these
cases, each isolated fact was capable of being accurately observed,
and certainly known; and the evidence demands our
assent, precisely as the like evidence upon any other indifferent
subject. The connexion of the word or the act of Jesus with
the restoration of the blind, lame and dead, to sight, and health,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and life, as cause and effect, is a conclusion which our reason is
compelled to admit, from the uniformity of their concurrence,
in such a multitude of instances, as well as from the universal
conviction of all, whether friends or foes, who beheld the
miracles which he wrought. Indeed, if the truth of one of the
miracles is satisfactorily established, our belief cannot reasonably
be withheld from them all. This is the issue proposed by
Dr. Paley, in regard to the evidence of the death of Jesus upon
the cross, and his subsequent resurrection, the truth of which
he has established in an argument, incapable of refutation.

§ 39. In the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fifth</span></em> place, as to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the coincidence of their testimony
with collateral and contemporaneous facts and circumstances</span></em>.
After a witness is dead, and his moral character is forgotten,
we can ascertain it only by a close inspection of his narrative,
comparing its details with each other, and with contemporary
accounts and collateral facts. This test is much more accurate
than may at first be supposed. Every event which actually
transpires, has its appropriate relation and place in the vast complication
of circumstances, of which the affairs of men consist;
it owes its origin to the events which have preceded it, is intimately
connected with all others which occur at the same time
and place, and often with those of remote regions, and in its
turn gives birth to numberless others which succeed. In all
this almost inconceivable contexture, and seeming discord, there
is perfect harmony; and while the fact, which really happened,
tallies exactly with every other contemporaneous incident,
related to it in the remotest degree, it is not possible for the
wit of man to invent a story, which, if closely compared with
the actual occurrences of the same time and place, may not be
shown to be false.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> Hence it is, that a false witness will not
willingly detail any circumstances, in which his testimony will
be open to contradiction, nor multiply them where there is
danger of his being detected by a comparison of them with
other accounts, equally circumstantial. He will rather deal in
general statements and broad assertions, and if he finds it
necessary for his purpose to employ names and particular circumstances
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in his story, he will endeavor to invent such as
shall be out of the reach of all opposing proof; and will be the
most forward and minute in details, where he knows that any
danger of contradiction is least to be apprehended.<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a> Therefore
it is, that variety and minuteness of detail are usually regarded
as certain tests of sincerity, if the story, in the circumstances
related, is of a nature capable of easy refutation if it were false.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 40. The difference, in the detail of circumstances, between
artful or false witnesses and those who testify the truth, is
worthy of especial observation. The former are often copious
and even profuse in their statements, as far as these may have
been previously fabricated, and in relation to the principal
matter; but beyond this, all will be reserved and meagre, from
the fear of detection. Every lawyer knows how lightly the
evidence of a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">non-mi-recordo</span></span> witness is esteemed. The testimony
of false witnesses will not be uniform in its texture, but
will be unequal, unnatural, and inconsistent. On the contrary,
in the testimony of true witnesses there is a visible and
striking naturalness of manner, and an unaffected readiness and
copiousness in the detail of circumstances, as well in one part
of the narrative as another, and evidently without the least
regard either to the facility or difficulty of verification or detection.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>
It is easier, therefore, to make out the proof of any fact,
if proof it may be called, by suborning one or more false witnesses,
to testify directly to the matter in question, than to
procure an equal number to testify falsely to such collateral and
separate circumstances as will, without greater danger of detection,
lead to the same false result. The increased number of
witnesses to circumstances, and the increased number of the
circumstances themselves, all tend to increase the probability of
detection if the witnesses are false, because thereby the points
are multiplied in which their statements may be compared with
each other, as well as with the truth itself, and in the same proportion
is increased the danger of variance and inconsistency.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Thus the force of circumstantial evidence is found to depend on
the number of particulars involved in the narrative; the difficulty
of fabricating them all, if false, and the great facility of detection;
the nature of the circumstances to be compared, and
from which the dates and other facts are to be collected; the
intricacy of the comparison; the number of the intermediate
steps in the process of deduction; and the circuity of the investigation.
The more largely the narrative partakes of these
characters, the further it will be found removed from all suspicion
of contrivance or design, and the more profoundly the
mind will repose on the conviction of its truth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 41. The narratives of the sacred writers, both Jewish and
Christian, abound in examples of this kind of evidence, the
value of which is hardly capable of being properly estimated.
It does not, as has been already remarked, amount to mathematical
demonstration; nor is this degree of proof justly demandable
in any question of moral conduct. In all human
transactions, the highest degree of assurance to which we can
arrive, short of the evidence of our own senses, is that of
probability. The most that can be asserted is, that the narrative
is more likely to be true than false; and it may be in the
highest degree more likely, but still be short of absolute mathematical
certainty. Yet this very probability may be so great as
to satisfy the mind of the most cautious, and enforce the assent
of the most reluctant and unbelieving. If it is such as usually
satisfies reasonable men, in matters of ordinary transaction, it is
all which the greatest sceptic has a right to require; for it is by
such evidence alone that our rights are determined, in the civil
tribunals; and on no other evidence do they proceed, even in
capital cases. Thus, where a house had been feloniously broken
open with a knife, the blade of which was broken and left in the
window, and the mutilated knife itself, the parts perfectly agreeing,
was found in the pocket of the accused, who gave no satisfactory
explanation of the fact, no reasonable doubt remained
of his participation in the crime. And where a murder had been
committed by shooting with a pistol, and the prisoner was connected
with the transaction by proof that the wadding of the
pistol was part of a letter addressed to him, the remainder of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which was found upon his person, no juror's conscience could
have reproached him for assenting to the verdict of condemnation.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>
Yet the evidence, in both cases, is but the evidence of
circumstances; amounting, it is true, to the highest degree of
probability, but yet not utterly inconsistent with the innocence
of the accused. The evidence which we have of the great facts
of the Bible history belongs to this class, that is, it is moral
evidence; sufficient to satisfy any rational mind, by carrying it
to the highest degree of moral certainty. If such evidence will
justify the taking away of human life or liberty, in the one case,
surely it ought to be deemed sufficient to determine our faith in
the other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 42. All that Christianity asks of men on this subject, is,
that they would be consistent with themselves; that they would
treat its evidences as they treat the evidence of other things;
and that they would try and judge its actors and witnesses, as
they deal with their fellow-men, when testifying to human
affairs and actions, in human tribunals. Let the witnesses be
compared with themselves, with each other, and with surrounding
facts and circumstances; and let their testimony be sifted,
as if it were given in a court of justice, on the side of the adverse
party, the witnesses being subjected to a rigorous cross-examination.
The result, it is confidently believed, will be an
undoubting conviction of their integrity, ability, and truth. In
the course of such an examination, the undesigned coincidences
will multiply upon us at every step in our progress; the probability
of the veracity of the witnesses and of the reality of the
occurrences which they relate will increase, until it acquires, for
all practical purposes, the value and force of demonstration.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 43. It should be remembered, that very little of the literature
of their times and country has come down to us; and that
the collateral sources and means of corroborating and explaining
their writings are proportionally limited. The contemporary
writings and works of art which have reached us, have invariably
been found to confirm their accounts, to reconcile what was
apparently contradictory, and supply what seemed defective or
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
imperfect. We ought therefore to conclude, that if we had
more of the same light, all other similar difficulties and imperfections
would vanish. Indeed they have been gradually
vanishing, and rapidly too, before the light of modern research,
conducted by men of science in our own times. And it is
worthy of remark, that of all the investigations and discoveries
of travellers and men of letters, since the overthrow of the
Roman empire, not a vestige of antiquity has been found,
impeaching, in the slightest degree, the credibility of the
sacred writers; but, on the contrary, every result has tended to
confirm it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 44. The essential marks of difference between true narratives
of facts and the creations of fiction, have already been adverted
to. It may here be added that these attributes of truth are
strikingly apparent throughout the gospel histories, and that
the absence of all the others is equally remarkable. The writers
allude, for example, to the existing manners and customs, and
to the circumstances of the times and of their country, with the
utmost minuteness of reference. And these references are
never formally made, nor with preface and explanation, never
multiplied and heaped on each other, nor brought together, as
though introduced by design; but they are scattered broad-cast
and singly over every part of the story, and so connect themselves
with every incident related, as to render the detection of
falsehood inevitable. This minuteness, too, is not peculiar to
any one of the historians, but is common to them all. Though
they wrote at different periods, and without mutual concert,
they all alike refer incidentally to the same state of affairs, and
to the same contemporary and collateral circumstances. Their
testimony, in this view, stands on the same ground with that of
four witnesses, separately examined before different commissioners,
upon the same interrogatories, and all adverting
incidentally to the same circumstances as surrounding and
accompanying the principal transaction, to which alone their
attention is directed. And it is worthy of observation that
these circumstances were at that time of a peculiar character.
Hardly a state or kingdom in the world ever experienced so
many vicissitudes in its government and political relations, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
did Judea, during the period of the gospel history. It was
successively under the government of Herod the Great, of
Archelaus, and of a Roman magistrate; it was a kingdom, a
tetrarchate, and a province; and its affairs, its laws, and the
administration of justice, were all involved in the confusion and
uncertainty naturally to be expected from recent conquest. It
would be difficult to select any place or period in the history of
nations, for the time and scene of a fictitious history or an imposture,
which would combine so many difficulties for the
fabricator to surmount, so many contemporary writers to confront
him with, and so many facilities for the detection of
falsehood.<a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a>

§ 45. <span class="tei tei-q">“Had the evangelists been false historians,”</span> says Dr.
Chalmers, <span class="tei tei-q">“they would not have committed themselves upon
so many particulars. They would not have furnished the
vigilant inquirers of that period with such an effectual instrument
for bringing them into discredit with the people; nor
foolishly supplied, in every page of their narrative, so many
materials for a cross-examination, which would infallibly have
disgraced them. Now, we of this age can institute the same
cross-examination. We can compare the evangelical writers
with contemporary authors, and verify a number of circumstances
in the history, and government, and peculiar economy of
the Jewish people. We therefore have it in our power to institute
a cross-examination upon the writers of the New Testament;
and the freedom and frequency of their allusions to
these circumstances supply us with ample materials for it.
The fact, that they are borne out in their minute and incidental
allusions by the testimony of other historians, gives a strong
weight of what has been called circumstantial evidence in
their favour. As a specimen of the argument, let us confine
our observations to the history of our Saviour's trial, and execution,
and burial. They brought him to Pontius Pilate. We
know both from Tacitus and Josephus, that he was at that
time governor of Judea. A sentence from him was necessary
before they could proceed to the execution of Jesus; and we
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
know that the power of life and death was usually vested in
the Roman governor. Our Saviour was treated with derision;
and this we know to have been a customary practice at that
time, previous to the execution of criminals, and during the
time of it. Pilate scourged Jesus before he gave him up to be
crucified. We know from ancient authors, that this was a very
usual practice among the Romans. The accounts of an execution
generally run in this form: he was stripped, whipped, and
beheaded or executed. According to the evangelists, his accusation
was written on the top of the cross; and we learn from
Suetonius and others, that the crime of the person to be executed
was affixed to the instrument of his punishment. According
to the evangelists, this accusation was written in three
different languages; and we know from Josephus that it was
quite common in Jerusalem to have all public advertisements
written in this manner. According to the evangelists, Jesus
had to bear his cross; and we know from other sources of information,
that this was the constant practice of these times.
According to the evangelists, the body of Jesus was given up
to be buried at the request of friends. We know that, unless the
criminal was infamous, this was the law or the custom with all
Roman governors.”</span><a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href="#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a>

§ 46. There is also a striking naturalness in the characters
exhibited in the sacred historians, rarely if ever found in works
of fiction, and probably nowhere else to be collected in a similar
manner from fragmentary and incidental allusions and expressions,
in the writings of different persons. Take, for example,
that of Peter, as it may be gathered from the evangelists,
and it will be hardly possible to conceive that four persons,
writing at different times, could have concurred in the delineation
of such a character, if it were not real; a character too,
we must observe, which is nowhere expressly drawn, but is
shown only here and there, casually, in the subordinate parts

§ 47. There are other internal marks of truth in the narratives
of the evangelists, which, however, need here be only
alluded to, as they have been treated with great fulness and
force by able writers, whose works are familiar to all.<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> Among
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
these may be mentioned the nakedness of the narratives; the
absence of all parade by the writers about their own integrity,
of all anxiety to be believed, or to impress others with a good
opinion of themselves or their cause, of all marks of wonder, or
of desire to excite astonishment at the greatness of the events
they record, and of all appearance of design to exalt their
Master. On the contrary, there is apparently the most perfect
indifference on their part, whether they are believed or not;
or rather, the evident consciousness that they were recording
events well known to all, in their own country and times, and
undoubtedly to be believed, like any other matter of public
history, by readers in all other countries and ages. It is worthy,
too, of especial observation, that though the evangelists record
the unparalleled sufferings and cruel death of their beloved
Lord, and this too, by the hands and with the consenting voices
of those on whom he had conferred the greatest benefits, and
their own persecutions and dangers, yet they have bestowed no
epithets of harshness or even of just censure on the authors of
all this wickedness, but have everywhere left the plain and unincumbered
narrative to speak for itself, and the reader to
pronounce his own sentence of condemnation; like true witnesses,
who have nothing to gain or to lose by the event of the
cause, they state the facts, and leave them to their fate. Their
simplicity and artlessness, also, should not pass unnoticed, in
readily stating even those things most disparaging to themselves.
Their want of faith in their Master, their dulness of apprehension
of his teachings, their strifes for preëminence, their inclination
to call fire from heaven upon their enemies, their desertion of
their Lord in his hour of extreme peril; these, and many other
incidents tending directly to their own dishonour, are nevertheless
set down with all the directness and sincerity of truth, as
by men writing under the deepest sense of responsibility to
God. Some of the more prominent instances of this class of
proofs will be noticed hereafter, in their proper places, in the
narratives themselves.

§ 48. Lastly, the great character they have portrayed is perfect.
It is the character of a sinless Being; of one supremely
wise and supremely good. It exhibits no error, no sinister
intention, no imprudence, no ignorance, no evil passion, no
impatience; in a word, no fault; but all is perfect uprightness,
innocence, wisdom, goodness and truth. The mind of man has
never conceived the idea of such a character, even for his gods;
nor has history nor poetry shadowed it forth. The doctrines
and precepts of Jesus are in strict accordance with the attributes
of God, agreeably to the most exalted idea which we can form of
them, either from reason or from revelation. They are strikingly
adapted to the capacity of mankind, and yet are delivered with
a simplicity and majesty wholly divine. He spake as never man
spake. He spake with authority; yet addressed himself to the
reason and the understanding of men; and he spake with wisdom,
which men could neither gainsay nor resist. In his private life,
he exhibits a character not merely of strict justice, but of overflowing
benignity. He is temperate, without austerity; his
meekness and humility are signal; his patience is invincible;
truth and sincerity illustrate his whole conduct; every one of
his virtues is regulated by consummate prudence; and he both
wins the love of his friends, and extorts the wonder and admiration
of his enemies<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a>. He is represented in every variety of
situation in life, from the height of worldly grandeur, amid the
acclamations of an admiring multitude, to the deepest abyss of
human degradation and woe, apparently deserted of God and
man. Yet everywhere he is the same; displaying a character
of unearthly perfection, symmetrical in all its proportions, and
encircled with splendour more than human. Either the men of
Galilee were men of superlative wisdom, of extensive knowledge
and experience, and of deeper skill in the arts of deception,
than any and all others, before or after them, or they have truly
stated the astonishing things which they saw and heard.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The narratives of the evangelists are now submitted to the
reader's perusal and examination, upon the principles and by
the rules already stated. For this purpose, and for the sake of
more ready and close comparison, they are arranged in juxtaposition,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after the general order of the latest and most approved
harmonies. The question is not upon the strict propriety of
the arrangement, but upon the veracity of the witnesses and
the credibility of their narratives. With the relative merits of
modern harmonists, and with points of controversy among
theologians, the writer has no concern. His business is that of
a lawyer, examining the testimony of witnesses by the rules of
his own profession, in order to ascertain whether, if they had
thus testified on oath, in a court of justice, they would be
entitled to credit; and whether their narratives, as we now have
them, would be received as ancient documents, coming from
the proper custody. If so, then it is believed that every honest
and impartial man will act consistently with that result, by
receiving their testimony in all the extent of its import. To
write out a full commentary or argument upon the text, would
be a useless addition to the bulk of the volume; but a few notes
have been added for illustration of the narratives, and for the
clearing up of apparent discrepancies, as being all that members
of the legal profession would desire.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The accounts of the Resurrection and of the subsequent appearances of our Lord, have
been harmonised in various methods; of which the latest, and probably the best, is that
of Professor Robinson, in an article published in the Bibliotheca Sacra for February 1845,
vol. ii. pp. 162-189. As the best service the present writer could do to the English
reader, he has therefore here abridged that article, by omitting the introduction, and such
parts as relate to the Greek text, and a few other passages, which it seemed might be
spared without injury to the narrative itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Time of the Resurrection.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Matt. 26: 1, 2.  Mark 16: 1, 2, 9.  Luke 24: 1.  John 20: 1.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That the resurrection of our Lord took place before full daylight, on the first day of the
week, follows from the unanimous testimony of the Evangelists respecting the visit of the
women to the sepulchre. But the exact time at which he rose is nowhere specified.
According to the Jewish mode of reckoning, the Sabbath ended and the next day began
at sunset; so that had the resurrection occurred even before midnight, it would still have
been upon the first day of the week, and the third day after our Lord's burial. The
earthquake had taken place and the stone had been rolled away before the arrival of the
women; and so far as the immediate narrative is concerned, there is nothing to show that
all this might not have happened some hours earlier. Yet the words of Mark in another
place render it certain, that there could have been no great interval between these events
and the arrival of the women; since he affirms in v. 9, that Jesus <span class="tei tei-q">“had risen <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">early</span></em>, the
first day of the week;”</span> while in v. 2, he states that the women went out <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very early</span></em>.”</span>
A like inference may be drawn from the fact, that the affrighted guards first went to inform
the chief priests of these events, when the women returned to the city (Matt. 28: 11);
for it is hardly to be supposed, that after having been thus terrified by the earthquake and
the appearance of an angel, they would have waited any very long time before sending
information to their employers.—The body of Jesus had therefore probably lain in the
tomb not less than about thirty-six hours.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Visit of the Women to the Sepulchre.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Matt. 28: 1-8. Mark 16: 1-8. Luke 24: 1-11. John 20: 1, 2.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first notices we have of our Lord's resurrection, are connected with the visit of the
women to the sepulchre, on the morning of the first day of the week. According to Luke,
the women who had stood by the cross, went home and rested during the sabbath (23:56);
and Mark adds that after the sabbath was ended, that is, after sunset, and during
the evening, they prepared spices in order to go and embalm our Lord's body. They
were either not aware of the previous embalming by Joseph and Nicodemus; or else
they also wished to testify their respect and affection to their Lord, by completing, more
perfectly, what before had been done in haste; John 19: 40-42.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is in just this portion of the history, which relates to the visit of the women to the
tomb and the appearance of Jesus to them, that most of the alleged difficulties and discrepancies
in this part of the Gospel narratives are found. We will therefore take up the chief
of them in their order.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Time</span></span>. All the Evangelists agree in saying that the women went out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very early</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg 499]</span><a name="Pg499" id="Pg499" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the sepulchre. Matthew's expression is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as the day was dawning</span></span>. Mark's words are,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">very early</span></span>: which indeed are less definite, but are appropriate to denote the same point of
time. Luke has the more poetic term: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">deep morning</span></span>, i. e. early dawn. John's language
is likewise definite: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">early, while it was yet dark</span></span>. All these expressions go to fix the
time at what we call <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">early dawn</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">early twilight</span></span>; after the break of day, but while the
light is yet struggling with darkness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus far there is no difficulty; and none would ever arise, had not Mark added the
phrase, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the sun being risen</span></span>; or, as the English version has it, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">at the rising of the sun</span></span>.
These words seem, at first, to be at direct variance both with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">very early</span></span> of Mark himself,
and with the language of the other Evangelists. To harmonise this apparent discrepancy,
we may premise, that since Mark himself first specifies the point of time by a phrase
sufficiently definite in itself, and supported by all the other Evangelists, we must conclude
that when he adds, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">at the rising of the sun</span></span>, he did not mean to contradict himself, but
used this latter phrase in a broader and less definite sense. As the sun is the source of
light and of the day, and as his earliest rays produce the contrast between darkness and
light, between night and dawn, so the term sunrising might easily come in popular
language, by a metonymy of cause for effect, to be put for all that earlier interval, when
his rays, still struggling with darkness, do nevertheless usher in the day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Accordingly, we find such a popular usage prevailing among the Hebrews; and several
instances of it occur in the Old Testament. Thus in Judg. 9: 33, the message of Zebul
to Abimelech, after directing him to lie in wait with his people in the field during the
night, goes on as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“and it shall be, in the morning, as soon as the sun is up thou
shalt rise early and set upon the city;”</span> yet we cannot for a moment suppose that Abimelech
with his ambuscade was to wait until the sun actually appeared above the horizon,
before he made his onset. So the Psalmist (104: 22), speaking of the young lions that
by night roar after their prey, goes on to say: <span class="tei tei-q">“The sun ariseth, they gather themselves
together, and lay them down in their dens.”</span> But wild animals do not wait for the actual
appearance of the sun ere they shrink away to their lairs; the break of day, the dawning
light, is the signal for their retreat. See also Sept. 2 K. 3:22. 2 Sam. 23:4. In all
these passages the language is entirely parallel to that of Mark; and they serve fully to
illustrate the principle, that the rising of the sun is here used in a popular sense as equivalent
to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rising of the day</span></span> or early dawn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Number of the Women.</span></span> Matthew mentions Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary; v. 1. Mark enumerates Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome;
v. 1. Luke has Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and others with
them; v. 10. John speaks of Mary Magdalene alone, and says nothing of any other. The
first three Evangelists accord then in respect to the two Marys, but no further; while
John differs from them all. Is there here a real discrepancy?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We may at once answer, No; because, according to the sound canon of Le Clerc:<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Qui plura narrat, pauciora complectitur; qui pauciora memorat, plura non negat.</span></span>”</span>
Because John, in narrating circumstances with which he was personally connected, sees
fit to mention only Mary Magdalene, it does not at all follow that others were not present.
Because Matthew, perhaps for like reasons, speaks only of the two Marys, he by no means
excludes the presence of others. Indeed, the very words which John puts into the mouth
of Mary Magdalene, (v. 2), presupposes the fact, that others had gone with her to the
sepulchre. That there was something in respect to Mary Magdalene, which gave her a
peculiar prominence in these transactions, may be inferred from the fact, that not only
John mentions her alone, but likewise all the other Evangelists name her first, as if
holding the most conspicuous place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The instance here under consideration is parallel to that of the demoniacs of Gadara,
and the blind men at Jericho; where, in both cases, Matthew speaks of two persons,
while Mark and Luke mention only one.<a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a> Something peculiar in the station or character
of one of the persons, rendered him in each case more prominent, and led the two latter
Evangelists to speak of him particularly. But there, as here, their language is not exclusive;
nor is there in it anything that contradicts the statements of Matthew.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Arrival at the Sepulchre.</span></span> According to Mark, Luke, and John, the women
on reaching the sepulchre found the great stone, with which it had been closed, already
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a name="Pg500" id="Pg500" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rolled away. Matthew, on the other hand, after narrating that the women went out to
see the sepulchre, proceeds to mention the earthquake, the descent of the angel, his rolling
away the stone and sitting upon it, and the terror of the watch, as if all these things took
place in the presence of the women. The angel too (in v. 5) addresses the women, as if
still sitting upon the stone he had rolled away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The apparent discrepancy, if any, here arises simply from Matthew's brevity in omitting
to state in full what his own narrative presupposes. According to v. 6, Christ was
already risen; and therefore the earthquake and its accompaniments must have taken place
at an earlier point of time, to which the sacred writer returns back in his narration. And
although Matthew does not represent the women as entering the sepulchre, yet in v. 8,
he speaks of them as going out of it; so that of course their interview with the angel took
place, not outside of the sepulchre, but in it, as narrated by the other Evangelists. When
therefore the angel says to them in v. 6, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come, see the place where the Lord lay,”</span> this
is not said without the tomb to induce them to enter, as Strauss avers; but within the
sepulchre, just as in Mark v. 6.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Vision of Angels in the Sepulchre.</span></span> Of this John says nothing. Matthew
and Mark speak of one angel; Luke of two. Mark says he was sitting; Luke speaks of
them as standing. This difference in respect to numbers is parallel to the case of the
women, which we have just considered; and requires therefore no further illustration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is likewise some diversity in the language addressed to the women by the angels.
In Matthew and Mark, the prominent object is the charge to the disciples to depart into
Galilee. In Luke this is not referred to; but the women are reminded of our Lord's own
previous declaration, that he would rise again on the third day. Neither of the Evangelists
here professes to report <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> that was said by the angels; and of course there is no room for
contradiction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The return of the Women to the city, and the first appearance of our Lord.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Matt. 28: 7-10. Mark 16: 8. Luke 24: 9-11. John 20: 1, 2.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John, speaking of Mary Magdalene alone, says that having seen that the stone was taken
away from the sepulchre, she went in haste (ran) to tell Peter and John. He says nothing
of her having seen the angels, nor of her having entered the sepulchre at all. The other
Evangelists, speaking of the women generally, relate that they entered the tomb, saw the
angels and then returned into the city. On their way Jesus meets them. They recognize
him; fall at and embrace his feet; and receive his charge to the disciples.—Was Mary
Magdalene now with the other women? Or did she enter the city by another way? Or
had she left the sepulchre before the rest?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is evident that Mary Magdalene was not with the other women when Jesus thus met
them. Her language to Peter and John forbids the supposition, that she had already seen
the Lord: <span class="tei tei-q">“They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where
they have laid him.”</span> She therefore must have entered the city by another path and gate;
or else have left the sepulchre before the rest; or possibly both these positions may be
true. She bore her tidings expressly to Peter and John, who would seem to have lodged
by themselves in a different quarter of the city; while the other women went apparently to
the rest of the disciples. But this supposition of a different route is essential, only in
connection with the view, that she left the tomb with the other women. That, however,
she actually departed from the sepulchre before her companions, would seem most probable;
inasmuch as she speaks to Peter and John only of the absence of the Lord's body; says
nothing in this connection of a vision of angels; and when, after returning again to the
tomb, she sees the angels, it is evidently for the first time; and she repeats to them as the
cause of her grief her complaint as to the disappearance of the body; John 20: 12, 13.
She may have turned back from the tomb without entering it at all, so soon as she saw
that it was open; inferring from the removal of the stone, that the sepulchre had been
rifled. Or, she may first have entered with the rest, when, according to Luke, <span class="tei tei-q">“they
found not the body of the Lord Jesus,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“were much perplexed thereabout,”</span> before
the angels became visible to them. The latter supposition seems best to meet the
exigencies of the case.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“As the other women went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All
hail. And they came, and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. Then Jesus said
unto them, Be not afraid; go, tell my brethren, that they go into Galilee, and there shall
they see me.”</span> The women had left the sepulchre <span class="tei tei-q">“with fear and great joy”</span> after the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page501">[pg 501]</span><a name="Pg501" id="Pg501" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
declaration of the angels that Christ was risen; or, as Mark has it, <span class="tei tei-q">“they trembled and
were amazed.”</span> Jesus meets them with words of gentleness to quiet their terrors; <span class="tei tei-q">“Be
not afraid.”</span> He permits them to approach, and embrace his feet, and testify their joy and
homage. He reiterates to them the message of the angels to his <span class="tei tei-q">“brethren,”</span> the eleven
disciples; see v. 16.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This appearance and interview is narrated only by Matthew; none of the other
Evangelists give any hint of it. Matthew here stops short. Mark simply relates that the
women fled from the tomb; <span class="tei tei-q">“neither said they anything to any one, for they were afraid.”</span>
This of course can only mean, that they spoke of what they had thus seen to no one while
on their way to the city; for the very charge of the angels, which they went to fulfil, was,
that they should <span class="tei tei-q">“go their way and tell his disciples;”</span> v. 7. Luke narrates more fully,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“they returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to
all the rest.—And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.”</span>
We may perhaps see in this language one reason why the other Evangelists have omitted to
mention this appearance of our Lord. The disciples <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disbelieved the report of the women</span></em>,
that they had seen Jesus. In like manner they afterwards disbelieved the report of Mary
Magdalene to the same effect; Mark 16: 11. They were ready, it would seem, to admit
the testimony of the women to the absence of the body, and to the vision of angels; but
not to the resurrection of Jesus and his appearance to them; Luke 24: 21-24. And
afterwards, when the eleven had become convinced by the testimony of their own senses,
those first two appearances to the women became of less importance and were less regarded.
Hence the silence of three Evangelists as to the one; of two as to the other; and of Paul
as to both; 1 Cor. 15: 5, 6.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
§ 4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peter and John visit the Sepulchre. Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
John 20: 3-18. Luke 24: 12. Mark 16: 9-11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The full account of these two events is given solely by John. Matthew has not a word
of either; Luke merely mentions, in general, that Peter, on the report of the women,
went to the sepulchre; while Mark speaks only of our Lord's appearance to Mary
Magdalene, which he seems to represent as his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> appearance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to John's account, Peter and the beloved disciple, excited by the tidings of
Mary Magdalene that the Lord's body had been taken away, hasten to the sepulchre.
They run; John outruns Peter, comes first to the tomb, and stooping down, sees the
grave-clothes lying, but he does not enter. The other women are no longer at the tomb;
nor have the disciples met them on the way. Peter now comes up; he enters the the tomb,
and sees the grave-clothes lying, and the napkin that was about his head not lying with
the rest, but wrapped together in a place by itself. John too now enters the sepulchre;
<span class="tei tei-q">“and he saw and believed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What was it that John thus believed? The mere report of Mary Magdalene, that
the body had been removed? So much he must have believed when he stooped down
and looked into the sepulchre. For this, there was no need that he should enter the
tomb. His belief must have been of something more and greater. The grave-clothes
lying orderly in their place, and the napkin folded together by itself, made it evident
that the sepulchre had not been rifled nor the body stolen by violent hands; for these
garments and spices would have been of more value to thieves, than merely a naked
corpse; at least, they would not have taken the trouble thus to fold them together.
The same circumstances showed also that the body had not been removed by friends;
for they would not thus have left the grave-clothes behind. All these considerations
produce in the mind of John the germ of a belief that Jesus was risen from the dead.

now began more fully to recall and understand our Lord's repeated declaration, that he
was to rise again on the third day;<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a> a declaration on which the Jews had already acted

want of connection between verses 8 and 9, disappears.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The two disciples went their way, <span class="tei tei-q">“wondering in themselves at what was come to pass.”</span>
Mary Magdalene who had followed them back to the sepulchre, remained before it weeping.
While she thus wept, she too, like John, stooped down and looked in, <span class="tei tei-q">“and seeth two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page502">[pg 502]</span><a name="Pg502" id="Pg502" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
angels, in white, sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body
of Jesus had lain.”</span> To their inquiry why she wept, her reply was the same report which
she had before borne to the two disciples: <span class="tei tei-q">“Because they have taken away my Lord,
and I know not where they have laid him,”</span> v. 13. Of the angels we learn nothing
further. The whole character of this representation seems to show clearly, that Mary
had not before seen the angels; and also that she had not before been told, that Jesus
was risen. We must otherwise regard her as having been in a most unaccountably obtuse
and unbelieving frame of mind; the very contrary of which seems to have been the fact.
If also she had before informed the two disciples of a vision of angels and of Christ's
resurrection, it is difficult to see, why John should omit to mention this circumstance, so
important and so personal to himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After replying to the angels, Mary turns herself about, and sees a person standing near,
whom, from his being present there, she takes to be the keeper of the garden. He too
inquires, why she weeps. Her reply is the same as before; except that she, not
unnaturally, supposes him to have been engaged in removing the body, which she desires
to recover. He simply utters in reply, in well-known tones, the name Mary! and the
whole truth flashes upon her soul; doubt is dispelled, and faith triumphs. She exclaims:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Rabboni!”</span> as much as to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“My dearest Master!”</span> and apparently, like the other
women,<a id="noteref_316" name="noteref_316" href="#note_316"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a> falls at his feet in order to embrace and worship him. This Jesus forbids her
to do, in these remarkable words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Touch me not: for I am not yet ascended to my
Father. But go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your
Father, and to my God and your God;”</span> v. 17.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There remains to be considered the circumstance, that Mark, in v. 9, seems to
represent this appearance of Jesus at the sepulchre to Mary Magdalene, as his first
appearance: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now, being risen early the first of the week, he appeared <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> to
Mary Magdalene.”</span> In attempting to harmonize this with Matthew's account of our
Lord's appearance to the other women on their return from the sepulchre, several
methods have been adopted; but the most to the purpose is the view which regards
the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></span>, in Mark v. 9, as put not absolutely, but relatively. That is to say,
Mark narrates three, and only three, appearances of our Lord; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">of these three</span></span>, that to Mary
Magdalene takes place <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>, and that to the assembled disciples the same evening occurs
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">last</span></span>, v. 14. A similar example occurs in 1 Cor. 15: 5-8, where Paul enumerates
those to whom the Lord showed himself after his resurrection, viz. to Peter, to the twelve,
to five hundred brethren, to James, to all the apostles, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">last of all</span></span> to Paul also. Now
had Paul written here, as with strict propriety he might have done, <span class="tei tei-q">“he was seen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></span> of
Cephas,”</span> assuredly no one would ever have understood him as intending to assert that the
appearance to Peter was the first absolutely; that is, as implying that Jesus was seen of
Peter before he appeared to Mary Magdalene and the other women. In like manner when
John declares (21: 14) that Jesus showed himself to his disciples by the lake of Galilee
for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em> time after he was risen from the dead; this is said relatively to the two
previous appearances to the assembled apostles; and does by no means exclude the four
still earlier appearances, viz. to Peter, to the two at Emmaus, to Mary Magdalene, and to
the other women,—one of which John himself relates in full.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this way the old difficulty in the case before us disappears; and the complex and
cumbrous machinery of earlier commentators becomes superfluous.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After her interview with Jesus, Mary Magdalene returns to the city, and tells the
disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken these things unto her.
According to Mark (vs. 10, 11), the disciples were <span class="tei tei-q">“mourning and weeping;”</span> and when
the heard that Jesus was alive and had been seen of her, they believed not.

This appearance on the way to Emmaus is related in full only by Luke. Mark merely
notes the fact; while the other two Evangelists and Paul (1 Cor. 15: 5) make no mention
of it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the afternoon of the same day on which our Lord arose, two of his disciples, one of
them named Cleopas, were on their way on foot to a village called Emmaus, sixty stadia
or seven and a half Roman miles distant from Jerusalem,—a walk of some two or two
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page503">[pg 503]</span><a name="Pg503" id="Pg503" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and a half hours. They had heard and credited the tidings brought by the women,
and also by Peter and John, that the sepulchre was open and empty; and that the women
had also seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive. They had most probably
likewise heard the reports of Mary Magdalene and the other women, that Jesus himself
had appeared to them; but these they did not regard, and do not mention them (v. 24);
because they, like the other disciples, had looked upon them <span class="tei tei-q">“as idle tales, and they
believed them not;”</span> v. 11. As they went, they were sad, and talked together of all these
things which had happened. After some time Jesus himself drew near and went with
them. But they knew him not. Mark says he was in another form; Luke affirms
that <span class="tei tei-q">“their eyes were holden, that they should not know him;”</span> v. 16. Was there in this
anything miraculous? The <span class="tei tei-q">“another form”</span> of Mark, Doddridge explains by <span class="tei tei-q">“a different
habit from what he ordinarily wore.”</span> His garments, of course, were not his former ones;
and this was probably one reason why Mary Magdalene had before taken him for
the keeper of the garden.<a id="noteref_317" name="noteref_317" href="#note_317"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">317</span></span></a> It may be, too, that these two disciples had not been
intimately acquainted with the Lord. He had arrived at Jerusalem only six days before
his crucifixion; and these might possibly have been recent converts, who had not before
seen him. To such, the change of garments, and the unexpectedness of the meeting,
would render a recognition more difficult; nor could it be regarded as surprising, that
under such circumstances they should not know him. Still, all this is hypothesis; and the
averment of Luke, that <span class="tei tei-q">“their eyes were holden,”</span> and the manner of our Lord's parting
from them afterwards, seem more naturally to imply that the idea of a supernatural
agency, affecting not Jesus himself, but the eyes or minds of the two disciples, was in the
mind of the sacred writer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus inquires the cause of their sadness; chides them for their slowness of heart
to believe what the prophets had spoken; and then proceeds to expound unto them <span class="tei tei-q">“in
all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.”</span> They feel the power of his words; and
their hearts burn within them. By this time they drew nigh to the village whither they
went; it was toward evening, and the day was far spent. Their journey was ended; and
Jesus was about to depart from them. In accordance with oriental hospitality they
constrained him to remain with them. He consents; and as he sat at meat with them, he
took bread, and blessed and brake, and gave unto them. At this time, and in connection
with this act, their eyes were opened; they knew him; and he vanished away from them.
Here too the question is raised, whether the language necessarily implies anything miraculous?
Our English translators have rendered this passage in the margin, <span class="tei tei-q">“he ceased to
be seen of them;”</span> and have referred to Luke 4: 30, and John 8: 59, as illustrating this
idea. They might also have referred to Acts 8: 39. Still, the language is doubtless such
as the sacred writers would most naturally have employed in order directly to express the
idea of supernatural agency.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Full of wonder and joy, the two disciples set off the same hour and return to Jerusalem.
They find the eleven and other disciples assembled; and as they enter, they are met with
the joyful exclamation: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared unto Simon;”</span>
v. 34.  They then rehearse what had happened to themselves; but, according to Mark,
the rest believed them not. As in the case of the women, so here, there would seem to
have been something in the position or character of these two disciples, which led the
others to give less credit to their testimony, than to that of Peter, one of the leading
apostles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This appearance to Peter is mentioned by no other Evangelist; and we know nothing of
the particular time, nor of the attending circumstances. It would seem to have taken
place either not long before, or else shortly after, that to the two disciples. It had not
happened when they left Jerusalem for Emmaus; or, at least, they had not heard of it.
It had occurred when they returned; and that long enough before to have been fully
reported to all the disciples and believed by them. It may perhaps have happened about
the time when the two disciples set off, or shortly afterwards.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Paul, in enumerating those by whom the Lord was seen after his resurrection (1 Cor.
15: 5), mentions Peter first; passing over the appearances to the women, and also that
to the two disciples; probably because they did not belong among the apostles.

The narrative of our Lord's first appearance to the apostles is most fully given by Luke:
John adds a few circumstances; and Mark, as well as Luke, has preserved the first charge
thus privately given to the apostles, to preach the Gospel in all the world,—a charge afterwards
repeated in a more public and solemn manner on the mountain in Galilee. When
Paul says the Lord appeared to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the twelve</span></span>, he obviously employs this number as being the
usual designation of the apostles; and very probably includes both the occasion narrated
in this section. Mark and Luke speak in like manner of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the eleven</span></span>; and yet we know
from John, that Thomas was not at first among them; so that of course only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></em> were
actually present.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to Mark, the disciples were at their evening meal; which implies a not very
late hour. John says the doors were shut, for fear of the Jews. While the two who had
returned from Emmaus were still recounting what had happened unto them, Jesus himself
<span class="tei tei-q">“came and stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you!”</span>
The question here again is raised, whether this entrance of our Lord was miraculous? That
it might have been so, there is no reason to doubt. He who in the days of his flesh
walked upon the waters, and before whose angel the iron gate of the prison opened of its
own accord so that Peter might pass out; he who was himself just risen from the dead;
might well in same miraculous way present himself to his followers in spite of bolts and
bars. But does the language here necessarily imply a miracle? The doors indeed were
shut; but the word used does not of itself signify that they were bolted or fastened. The
object no doubt was, to prevent access to spies from the Jews; or also to guard themselves
from the danger of being arrested; and both these objects might perhaps have been as
effectually accomplished by a watch at or before the door. Nor do the words used of our
Lord strictly indicate anything miraculous. We do not find here a form of the word commonly
employed to express the sudden appearance of angels; but, <span class="tei tei-q">“he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">came</span></span> and stood in
the midst of them;”</span> implying <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span> nothing more than the ordinary mode of approach.
There is, in fact, nothing in the whole account to suggest a miracle, except the remark of
John respecting the doors; and as this circumstance is not mentioned either by Mark or
Luke, it may be doubtful whether we are necessarily compelled by the language to regard
the mode of our Lord's entrance as miraculous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At this interview Thomas was not present. On his return the other disciples relate to
him the circumstances. But Thomas now disbelieved the others; as they before had disbelieved
the women. His reply was, <span class="tei tei-q">“except I shall see in his hands the print of the
nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I
will not believe.”</span> Our Lord had compassion upon his perverseness. Eight days afterwards,
when the disciples were again assembled and Thomas with them, our Lord came as
before, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you! He permits to Thomas the
test he had demanded; and charges him to be not faithless, but believing. Thomas, convinced
and abashed, exclaims in the fulness of faith and joy, My Lord and my God!
recognising and acknowledging thereby the divine nature thus manifested in the flesh.
The reply of our Lord to Thomas is strikingly impressive and condemnatory of his want
of faith: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they that
have not seen, and yet have believed!”</span> He and the other disciples, who were to be the
heralds of the Lord's resurrection to the world as the foundation of the hope of the Gospel,
refused to believe except upon the evidence of their own senses; while all who after them
have borne the Christian Name, have believed this great fact of the Gospel solely upon
their testimony. God has overruled their unbelief for good, in making it a powerful argument
for the truth of their testimony in behalf of this great fact, which they themselves
were so slow to believe. Blessed, indeed, are they who have received their testimony.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It appears from the narrative of Matthew, that while the disciples were yet in Jerusalem,
our Lord had appointed a time, when he would meet them in Galilee, upon a certain
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page505">[pg 505]</span><a name="Pg505" id="Pg505" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mountain.<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a> They therefore left Jerusalem after the passover, probably soon after the
interview at which Thomas was present, and returned to Galilee, their home. While
waiting for the appointed time, they engaged in their usual occupation of fishermen. On
a certain day, as John relates, towards evening, seven of them being together, including
Peter, Thomas, and the sons of Zebedee, they put out upon the lake with their nets in a
fishing boat; but during the whole night they caught nothing. At early dawn Jesus stood
upon the shore, from which they were not far off, and directed them to cast the net upon
the right side of the boat. <span class="tei tei-q">“They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it
for the multitude of the fishes.”</span> Recognising in this miracle their risen Lord, they pressed
around him. Peter, with his characteristic ardour, threw himself into the water in order
to reach him the sooner. At their Lord's command they prepared a meal from the fish
they had thus taken. <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus then cometh and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
likewise.”</span> This was his third appearance to the eleven; or rather to a large number of
them together. It was on this occasion, and after their meal, that our Lord put to Peter
the touching and thrice repeated question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lovest thou me?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At length the set time arrived; and the eleven disciples went away into the mountain
<span class="tei tei-q">“where Jesus had appointed them.”</span> It would seem most probable, that this time and
place had been appointed of our Lord for a solemn and more public interview, not only
with the eleven, whom he had already met, but with all his disciples in Galilee; and that
therefore it was on this same occasion, when, according to Paul, <span class="tei tei-q">“he was seen of above five
hundred brethren at once.”</span><a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a> That the interview was not confined to the eleven alone,
would seem evident from the fact that <span class="tei tei-q">“some doubted;”</span> for this could hardly be supposed
true of any of the eleven, after what had already happened to them in Jerusalem and
Galilee, and after having been appointed to meet their risen Lord at this very time and
place. The appearance of the five hundred must at any rate be referred to Galilee; for
even after our Lord's ascension, the number of the names in Jerusalem were together only
about an hundred and twenty.<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a> I do not hesitate, therefore, to hold with Flatt,
Olshausen, Hengstenberg, and others, that the appearances thus described by Matthew and
Paul, were identical. It was a great and solemn occasion. Our Lord had directed that
the eleven and all his disciples in Galilee should thus be convened upon the mountain. It
was the closing scene of his ministry in Galilee. Here his life had been spent. Here
most of his mighty works had been done and his discourses held. Here his followers were
as yet most numerous. He therefore here takes leave on earth of those among whom he
had lived and laboured longest; and repeats to all his disciples in public the solemn charge,
which he had already given in private to the apostles: <span class="tei tei-q">“Go ye therefore and teach all
nations:—and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.”</span> It was doubtless
his last interview with his disciples in that region,—his last great act in Galilee.

Luke relates, in Acts 1: 3, that Jesus showed himself alive to his apostles, <span class="tei tei-q">“after his
passion, by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the
things pertaining to the kingdom of God.”</span> This would seem to imply interviews and communications,
as to which we have little more than this very general notice. One of these
may have been the appearance to James, mentioned by Paul alone (1 Cor. 15: 7), as subsequent
to that to the five hundred brethren. It may be referred with most probability to
Jerusalem, after the return of the Apostles from Galilee. That this return took place by
the Lord's direction, there can be no doubt; although none of the Evangelists have given
us the slightest hint as to any such direction. Indeed, it is this very brevity,—this omission
to place on record the minor details which might serve to connect the great facts and
events of our Lord's last forty days on earth, that has occasioned all the doubt and difficulty
with which this portion of the written history of these events has been encompassed.—The
James here intended was probably our Lord's brother; who was of high consideration
in the church, and is often, in the latter books, simply so named without any special
designation.<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a> At the time when Paul wrote, the other James, <span class="tei tei-q">“the brother of John,”</span> as

After thus appearing to James, our Lord, according to Paul, was seen <span class="tei tei-q">“of all the
apostles.”</span> This, too, was apparently an appointed meeting; and was doubtless the same of
which Luke speaks, as occurring in Jerusalem immediately preceding the ascension. It
was, of course, the Lord's last interview with his apostles. He repeats to them the promise
of the baptism with the Holy Spirit as soon to take place; and charges them not to depart
from Jerusalem until this should be accomplished.<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a> Strange as it may appear, the twelve,
in this last solemn moment, put to him the question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord, wilt thou at this time restore
the kingdom to Israel?”</span> How, indeed, were they to believe! Their gross and darkened
minds, not yet enlightened by the baptism of the Spirit, clung still to the idea of a temporal
Prince and Saviour, who should deliver his people, not from their sins, but from the
galling yoke of Roman dominion. Our Lord deals gently with their ignorance and want of
faith: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not for you to know the times and seasons;—but ye shall receive the power
of the Holy Ghost coming upon you; and ye shall be witnesses unto me—unto the uttermost
part of the earth.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
During this discourse, or in immediate connection with it, our Lord leads them out <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as
far as to</span></span> Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them; Luke 24: 50. This act of
blessing must be understood, by all the laws of language, as having taken place at or near
Bethany. <span class="tei tei-q">“And it came to pass, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">while</span></span> he blessed them, he was parted from them, and
carried up into heaven.”</span> Our Lord's ascension, then, took place at or near Bethany.
Indeed, the sacred writer could hardly have found words to express this fact more definitely
and fully; and a doubt on this point could never have suggested itself to the mind of any
reader, but for the language of the same writer, in Acts 1: 12, where he relates that after
the ascension the disciples <span class="tei tei-q">“returned unto Jerusalem by the mount called Olivet.”</span> Luke
obviously did not mean to contradict himself; and the most that his expression can be
made to imply, is, that from Bethany, where their Lord had ascended, which lies on the
eastern slope of the Mount of Olives, a mile or more below the summit of the ridge, the
disciples returned to Jerusalem by a path across the mount.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As these disciples stood gazing and wondering, while a cloud received their Lord out of
their sight, two angels stood by them in white apparel, announcing unto them, that this
same Jesus, who was thus taken up from them into heaven, shall again so come, in like
manner as they had seen him go into heaven. With this annunciation closes the written
history of our Lord's resurrection and ascension.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The death of Jesus is universally regarded among Christians
as a cruel murder, perpetrated under the pretence of a legal
sentence, after a trial, in which the forms of law were essentially
and grossly violated. The Jews to this day maintain, that,
whatever were the merits of the case, the trial was at least
regular, and the sentence legally just; that he was accused of
blasphemy, and convicted of that offence by legal evidence.
The question between them involves two distinct points of
inquiry, namely, first, whether he was guilty of blasphemy; and,
secondly, whether the arraignment and trial were conducted in
the ordinary forms of law. But there will still remain a third
question, namely, whether, admitting that, as a mere man, he
had violated the law against blasphemy, he could legally be put
to death for that cause; and if not, then whether he was justly
condemned upon the new and supplemental accusation of
treason or of sedition, which was vehemently urged against
him. The first and last of these inquiries it is proposed briefly
to pursue; but it will be necessary previously to understand the
light in which he was regarded by the Jewish rulers and people,
the state of their criminal jurisprudence and course of proceeding,
and especially the nature and extent of the law
concerning blasphemy, upon which he was indicted.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the early period of the ministry of Jesus, he does not
appear to have excited among the Pharisees any emotion but
wonder and astonishment, and an intense interest respecting
the nature of his mission. But the people heard him with
increasing avidity, and followed him in countless throngs. He
taught a purer religion than the Scribes and Pharisees, whose
pride and corruption he boldly denounced. He preached charity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page508">[pg 508]</span><a name="Pg508" id="Pg508" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and humility, and perfect holiness of heart and life, as essential
to the favour of God, whose laws he expounded in all the depth
of their spirituality, in opposition to the traditions of the elders,
and the false glosses of the Scribes and Pharisees. These sects
he boldly charged with making void and rejecting the law of
God, and enslaving men by their traditions; he accused them
of hypocrisy, covetousness, oppression, and lust of power and
popularity; and denounced them as hinderers of the salvation
of others, as a generation of serpents and vipers, doomed to
final perdition. It was natural that these terrific denunciations,
from such a personage, supported by his growing power and the
increasing acclamations of the people, should alarm the partisans
of the ancient theocracy, and lead them to desire his
destruction. This alarm evidently increased with the progress
of his ministry; and was greatly heightened by the raising of
Lazarus from the dead, on which occasion the death of Jesus
was definitively resolved on;<a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a> but no active measures against
him seem to have been attempted, until the time when, under
the parable of the wicked husbandmen who cast the heir out of
the vineyard and slew him, he declared that the kingdom of
God should be taken from them, and given to others more
worthy. Perceiving that he spake this parable against them,
from that hour they sought to lay hands on him, and were
restrained only by fear of the popular indignation.<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having thus determined to destroy Jesus at all events, as a
person whose very existence was fatal to their own power, and
perhaps, in their view, to the safety of their nation, the first
step was to render him odious to the people; without which
the design would undoubtedly recoil on the heads of its contrivers,
his popularity being unbounded. Countless numbers had
received the benefit of his miraculous gifts; and it was therefore
deemed a vain attempt to found an accusation, at that time, on
any past transaction of his life. A new occasion was accordingly
sought, by endeavouring to <span class="tei tei-q">“entangle him in his talk;”</span>
a measure, planned and conducted with consummate cunning
and skill. The Jews were divided into two political parties.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a name="Pg509" id="Pg509" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
One of these consisted of the Pharisees, who held it unlawful to
acknowledge or pay tribute to the Roman emperor, because
they were forbidden, by the law of Moses,<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> to set a king over
them who was a stranger, and not one of their own countrymen.
The other party was composed of the partisans of Herod, who
understood this law to forbid only the voluntary election of a
stranger, and therefore esteemed it not unlawful to submit and
pay tribute to a conqueror. These two parties, though bitterly
opposed to each other, united in the attempt to entrap Jesus,
by the question,—<span class="tei tei-q">“Is it lawful to give tribute to Cæsar, or
not?”</span><a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a> If he answered in the negative, the Herodians were to
accuse him to Pilate, for treason; if in the affirmative, the
Pharisees would denounce him to the people, as an enemy to
their liberties.<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> This insidious design was signally frustrated
by the wisdom of his reply, when, referring to Cæsar's image
and legend, on the coins which they all received as legally
current, he showed the inconsistency of withholding the
honour due to one thus implicitly acknowledged by both
parties to be their lawful sovereign.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Defeated in this attempt to commit him politically, their next
endeavour was to render him obnoxious to one or the other of
the two great religious sects, which were divided upon the doctrine
of the resurrection, the Pharisees affirming, and the Sadducees
denying, that the dead would rise again. The latter he
easily silenced, by a striking exposition of their own law. They
asked him which, of several husbands, would be entitled in the
next world to the wife whom they successively had married in
this; and in reply, he showed them that in heaven the relation
of husband and wife was unknown.<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Their last trial was made by a lawyer, who sought to entrap
him into an assertion that one commandment in the law was
greater than another; a design rendered abortive by his reply
that they were all of equal obligation.<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It being apparent, from these successive defeats, that any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page510">[pg 510]</span><a name="Pg510" id="Pg510" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
farther attempt to find new matter of accusation would result
only in disgrace to themselves, the enemies of Jesus seem to
have come to the determination to secure his person secretly,
and afterwards to put him to death, in any manner that would
not render them odious to the people. In execution of this
design, they first bribed Judas to betray him by night into
their hands. This object being attained, the next step was to
destroy his reputation, and if possible to render him so vile in
the public estimation, as that his destruction would be regarded
with complacency. Now no charge could so surely produce
this effect, and none could so plausibly be preferred against him,
as that of blasphemy; a crime which the Jews regarded with
peculiar horror. Even their veneration of Jesus, and the awe
which his presence inspired, had not been sufficient to restrain
their rising indignation on several occasions, when they regarded
his language as the blasphemous arrogation of a divine character
and power to himself; and could they now be brought to believe
him a blasphemer, and see him legally convicted of this atrocious
crime, his destruction might easily be brought about,
without any very scrupulous regard to the form, and even with
honour to those by whom it might be accomplished.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will now be necessary to consider more particularly the
nature of the crime of blasphemy, in its larger signification, as
it may be deduced from the law of God. That the spirit of this
law requires from all men, everywhere, and at all times, the
profoundest veneration of the Supreme Being, and the most
submissive acknowledgment of Him as their rightful Sovereign,
is too plain to require argument. If proof were wanted, it is
abundantly furnished in the Decalogue,<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a> which is admitted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page511">[pg 511]</span><a name="Pg511" id="Pg511" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
among Christians to be of universal obligation. At the time
when the Jewish Theocracy was established, idolatry had become
generally prevalent, and men had nearly lost all just notions of
the nature and attributes of their Creator. It is therefore supposed
that the design of Jehovah, in forming the Jewish constitution
and code of laws, was to preserve the knowledge of
himself as the true God, and to retain that people in the strictest
possible allegiance to him alone; totally excluding every
acknowledgment of any other being, either as an object of
worship or a source of power. Hence the severity with which
he required that sorceries, divinations, witchcrafts and false
prophecies, as well as open idolatries, should be punished, they
being alike acts of treason, or, as we might say, of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">præmunire</span></span>,
amounting to the open acknowledgment of a power independent
of Jehovah. Hence, too, the great veneration in which he
commanded that his name and attributes should be held, even
in ordinary conversation. It is the breach of this last law, to
which the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">blasphemy</span></span>, in its more restricted sense, has
usually been applied;<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a> but originally the command evidently
extended to every word or act, directly in derogation of the
sovereignty of Jehovah, such as speaking in the name of another
god,<a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href="#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a> or omitting, on any occasion that required it, to give to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page512">[pg 512]</span><a name="Pg512" id="Pg512" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Jehovah the honour due to his own name.<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a> Thus, when Moses
and Aaron, at the command of God, smote the rock in Kadesh,
that from it waters might flow to refresh the famishing multitude,
but neglected to honour him as the source of the miraculous
energy, and arrogated it to themselves, saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hear now,
ye rebels, must <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></span> bring you water out of this rock?”</span><a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> this
omission drew on them his severe displeasure. <span class="tei tei-q">“And the Lord
spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to
sanctify <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">me</span></span> in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ye</span></span>
shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have
given them.”</span> Accordingly, both Moses and Aaron died before
the Israelites entered into the promised land.<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a> No other deity
was permitted to be invoked; no miracle must be wrought, but
in the name of God alone. <span class="tei tei-q">“I am Jehovah; that is my name;
and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to
graven images.”</span><a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337" href="#note_337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a> This was ever a cardinal principle of his law,
neither newly announced by Isaiah, nor by Moses. Its promulgation
on Mount Sinai was merely declaratory of what had
been well understood at the beginning, namely, that God alone
was the Lord of all power and might, and would be expressly
acknowledged as such, in every exertion of superhuman energy
or wisdom. Thus Joseph, when required to interpret the dream
of Pharaoh, replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh
an answer of peace.”</span><a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a> And Moses, in all the miracles previously
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page513">[pg 513]</span><a name="Pg513" id="Pg513" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wrought by him in Egypt, expressly denounced them
as the judgments of God, by whose hand alone they were
inflicted.<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href="#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> After the solemn re-enactment of this law on
Mount Sinai, its signal violation by Moses and Aaron deserved
to be made as signal an example of warning; and this judgment
of Jehovah may be said to constitute the leading case under
this article of the law; forming a rule of action and of judgment
for all cases of miracles which might be wrought in all coming
time. The same principle was afterwards expressly extended
to prophesying. <span class="tei tei-q">“The prophet—that shall speak in the name
of other gods, even that prophet shall die.”</span><a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a> His character of
prophet, and even his inspiration, shall not authorize him to
prophesy but in the name of the Lord. He shall not exercise
his office in his own name, nor in any name but that of Jehovah,
from whom his power was derived.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That such was understood to be the true meaning of this law
of God, is further evident from the practice of the prophets, in
later times, to whom was given the power of working miracles.
These they always wrought in his name, expressly acknowledged
at the time. Thus, the miracle of thunder and rain in the
season of the wheat-harvest, called for by Samuel, he expressly
attributed to the Lord.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a> So did Elijah, when he called fire
from heaven to consume his sacrifice, in refutation of the claims
of Baal.<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> So did Elisha, when he divided the waters of Jordan,
by smiting them with the mantle of Elijah;<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a> and again, when
he miraculously multiplied the loaves of bread, for the people
that were with him;<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a> and again, when he caused the young
man's eyes to be opened, that he might behold the hosts of
the Lord around him, and smote his enemies with blindness.<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page514">[pg 514]</span><a name="Pg514" id="Pg514" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
And even the angel Gabriel, when sent to interpret to Daniel
the things which should befall his people in the latter days,
explicitly announced himself as speaking in Jehovah's name.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same view of the sinfulness of exercising superhuman
power without an express acknowledgment of God as its author,
and of any usurpation of his authority, continued to prevail,
down to the time of our Saviour. Thus, when he said to the
sick of the palsy, <span class="tei tei-q">“Son, be of good cheer, thy sins be forgiven
thee,”</span> certain of the Scribes said within themselves, <span class="tei tei-q">“This man
blasphemeth. Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”</span><a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a> And
again, when the Jews, on another occasion, took up stones to
stone him, and Jesus, appealing to his good works done among
them, asked for which of them he was to be stoned; they
replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy,
and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.”</span><a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a>
Yet Jesus had on no occasion mentioned the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">name</span></em> of Jehovah,
but with profound reverence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus it appears that the law of blasphemy, as it was understood
among the Jews, extended not only to the offence of
impiously using the name of the Supreme Being, but to every
usurpation of his authority, or arrogation, by a created being,
of the honour and power belonging to him alone.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> Like the
crime of treason among men, its essence consisted in acknowledging
or setting up the authority of another sovereign than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page515">[pg 515]</span><a name="Pg515" id="Pg515" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one's own, or invading the powers pertaining exclusively to him;
an offence, of which the case of Moses, before cited, is a prominent
instance, both in its circumstances and in its punishment.
Whether a false god was acknowledged or the true one denied,
and whether the denial was in express terms, or by implication,
in assuming to do, by underived power, and in one's own name,
that which God only could perform, the offence was essentially
the same. And in such horror was it held by the Israelites,
that in token of it every one was obliged, by an early and universal
custom, to rend his garments, whenever it was committed
or related in his presence.<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> This sentiment was deeply felt
by the whole people, as a part of their religion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such being the general scope and spirit of the law, it would
seem to have been easy to prove that Jesus had repeatedly
incurred its penalties. He had performed many miracles, but
never in any other name than his own. In his own name, and
without the recognition of any higher power, he had miraculously
healed the sick, restored sight to the blind and strength
to the lame, cast out devils, rebuked the winds, calmed the sea,
and raised the dead. In his own name, also, and with no
allusion to the Omniscient, no <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus saith the Lord,”</span> he had
prophesied of things to come. He had by his own authority
forgiven sins, and promised, by his own power, not only to raise
the dead, but to resume his own life, after he should, as he predicted,
be put to death. Finally, he had expressly claimed for
himself a divine origin and character, and the power to judge
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page516">[pg 516]</span><a name="Pg516" id="Pg516" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
both the quick and the dead<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a>. Considered as a man, he had
usurped the attributes of God. That he was not arrested at an
earlier period, is to be attributed to his great popularity, and
the astounding effect of his miracles. His whole career had
been resplendent with beneficence to the thousands who surrounded
him. His eloquence surpassed all that had been
uttered by man. The people were amazed, bewildered, and
fascinated, by the resistless power of his life. It was not until
his last triumphal visit to Jerusalem, after he had openly
raised Lazarus from the dead, when the chief priests and elders
perceived that <span class="tei tei-q">“the world was gone after him,”</span> that they were
stricken with dismay and apprehension for their safety, and
under this panic resolved upon the perilous measure of his
destruction.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only safe method in which this could be accomplished,
was under the sanction of a legal trial and sentence. Jesus,
therefore, upon his apprehension, was first brought before the
great tribunal of the Sanhedrim, and charged with the crime of
blasphemy. What were the specifications under this general
charge, or whether any were necessary, we are not informed.
But that this was the offence charged, is manifest both from the
evidence adduced and from the judgment of conviction.<a id="noteref_352" name="noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a> Such
was the estimation in which he was held, that it was with great
difficulty that witnesses could be found to testify against him;
and the two who at last were procured, testified falsely, in
applying his words to the temple of Solomon, which he spake
of the temple of his body. When, upon the occasion of his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page517">[pg 517]</span><a name="Pg517" id="Pg517" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scourging the money-changers out of the temple, the Jews
demanded by what authority he did this, Jesus replied, alluding
to his own person, <span class="tei tei-q">“Destroy <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> temple, and in three days I
will raise it up.”</span><a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a> But though the witnesses swore falsely in
testifying that he spake of the Jewish temple, yet his words, in
either sense, amounted to a claim of the power of working
miracles, and so brought him within the law. The high priest,
however, still desirous of new evidence, which might justify his
condemnation in the eyes of the people, proceeded to interrogate
Jesus concerning his character and mission. <span class="tei tei-q">“I adjure
thee, by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the
Christ, the Son of God. Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said:
nevertheless, I say unto you, hereafter ye shall see the Son of
Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the
clouds of heaven. Then the high priest <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rent his clothes</span></span>, saying
He hath <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">spoken blasphemy</span></span>; what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">further</span></span> need have we of witnesses?
Behold, now <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ye have heard his blasphemy</span></span>. What
think ye? They answered and said, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He is guilty of death</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a>
We may suppose the multitude standing without the hall of
judgment, able, through its avenues and windows, to see, but
not to hear, all that was transacting within. It became important,
therefore, to obtain some reason upon which the high
priest might rend his clothes in their sight, thus giving to the
people, by this expressive and awful sign, the highest evidence
of blasphemy, uttered by Jesus in the presence of that august
assembly. This act turned the tide of popular indignation
against him, whose name, but a short time before, had been the
theme of their loudest hosannas. There was now no need to
go into the past transactions of his ministry, for matter of
accusation. His friends might claim for him on that score all
that the warmest gratitude and love could inspire; and all this
could be safely conceded. But here, his accusers might say,
was a new and shocking crime, just perpetrated in the presence
of the most sacred tribunal; a crime so shocking, and so boldly
committed, that the high priest rent his clothes with horror, in
the very judgment seat, in the presence of all the members
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page518">[pg 518]</span><a name="Pg518" id="Pg518" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Sanhedrim, who, with one accord, upon that evidence
alone, immediately convicted the offender and sentenced him
to death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we regard Jesus simply as a Jewish citizen, and with no
higher character, this conviction seems substantially right in
point of law, though the trial were not legal in all its forms.
For, whether the accusation were founded on the first or second
commands in the decalogue, or on the law, laid down in the
thirteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, or on that in the eighteenth
chapter and twentieth verse, he had violated them all, by assuming
to himself powers belonging alone to Jehovah. And even
if he were recognized as a prophet of the Lord, he was still
obnoxious to punishment, under the decision in the case of
Moses and Aaron, before cited. It is not easy to perceive on
what ground his conduct could have been defended before any
tribunal, unless upon that of his superhuman character. No
lawyer, it is conceived, would think of placing his defence upon
any other basis.

The great object of exciting the people against Jesus being
thus successfully accomplished, the next step was to obtain legal
authority to put him to death. For though the Sanhedrim had
condemned him, they had not the power to pass a capital
sentence; this being a right which had passed from the Jews
by the conquest of their country, and now belonged to the
Romans alone. They were merely citizens of a Roman province;
they were left in the enjoyment of their civil laws, the
public exercise of their religion, and many other things relating
to their police and municipal regulations; but they had not the
power of life and death. This was a principal attribute of
sovereignty, which the Romans always took care to reserve to
themselves in order to be able to reach those individuals who
might become impatient of the yoke, whatever else might be
neglected. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Apud quos (Romanos), vis imperii valet; inania

fill the places of governors, (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Vice Præsides</span></span>,) as clearly appears
from the Roman laws. The government of all Syria was at this

one of the lesser dependencies, under the charge of Pilate as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It could not be expected that Pilate would trouble himself
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page520">[pg 520]</span><a name="Pg520" id="Pg520" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with the cognizance of any matter, not pertaining to the
Roman law; much less with an alleged offence against the God
of the Jews, who was neither acknowledged nor even respected
by their conquerors. Of this the chief priests and elders were
fully aware; and therefore they prepared a second accusation
against Jesus, founded on the Roman law; as likely to succeed
with Pilate, as the former had done with the people. They
charged him with attempting to restore the kingdom of Israel,
under his own dominion as king of the Jews. <span class="tei tei-q">“We found
this fellow, said they, perverting the nation, and forbidding to
give tribute to Cæsar, saying, That he himself is Christ, a
king.”</span><a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href="#note_357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was a charge of high treason against the Roman state and
emperor; a charge which was clearly within Pilate's cognizance,
and which, as they well knew, no officer of Tiberius would
venture lightly to regard. Pilate accordingly forthwith arraigned
Jesus, and called upon him to answer this accusation.
It is worthy of note, that from the moment when he was
accused of treason before Pilate, no further allusion was made
to the previous charge of blasphemy; the Roman governor
being engaged solely with the charge newly preferred before
himself. The answer of Jesus to this charge satisfied Pilate
that it was groundless, the kingdom which he set up appearing
plainly to be not a kingdom of this world, but his spiritual reign
in righteousness and holiness and peace, in the hearts of men.
Pilate therefore acquitted him of the offence. <span class="tei tei-q">“He went out
again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I find in him no fault
at all</span></span>.”</span><a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href="#note_358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a> Here was a sentence of acquittal, judicially pronounced,
and irreversible, except by a higher power, upon
appeal; and it was the duty of Pilate thereupon to have
discharged him. But the multitude, headed now by the priests
and elders, grew clamorous for his execution; adding, <span class="tei tei-q">“He
stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning
from Galilee to this place.”</span><a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href="#note_359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a> Hearing this reference to
Galilee, Pilate seized the opportunity, thus offered, of escaping
from the responsibility of a judgment, either of acquittal or of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page521">[pg 521]</span><a name="Pg521" id="Pg521" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
condemnation, by treating the case as out of his jurisdiction,
and within that of Herod, tetrarch of Galilee, who was then in
Jerusalem on a visit. He therefore sent Jesus and his accusers
to Herod; before whom the charge was vehemently renewed
and urged. But Herod, too, perceived that it was utterly
groundless, and accordingly treated it with derision, arraying
Jesus in mock habiliments of royalty, and remanding him to
Pilate.<a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href="#note_360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a> The cause was then solemnly re-examined by the
Roman governor, and a second judgment of acquittal pronounced.
For <span class="tei tei-q">“Pilate, when he had called together the chief
priests and the rulers, and the people, said unto them, Ye have
brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people;
and behold, I having examined him before you, have found no
fault in this man, touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and lo, nothing
worthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chastise him
and release him.”</span><a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may seem strange to us that after a judgment of acquittal
thus solemnly pronounced, any judge, in a civilized country,
should venture to reverse it, upon the same evidence, and
without the pretence of mistake or error in the proceedings.
Probably, in the settled jurisprudence of the city of Rome, it
could not have been done. But this was in a remote province
of the empire, under the administration not of a jurist, but a
soldier; and he, too, irresolute and vacillating; fearful for his
office, and even for his life, for he served the <span class="tei tei-q">“dark and
unrelenting Tiberius.”</span> As soon as he proposed to release
Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go,

speaketh against Cæsar.”</span><a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> Whereupon <span class="tei tei-q">“Pilate gave sentence

the tenor of the writing placed over his head, stating that he

In the preceding remarks, the case has been considered only
upon its general merits, and with no reference to the manner in
which the proceedings were conducted. But M. Dupin, in his
tract on the Trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrim, in reply to
Mr. Salvador's account of it, has satisfactorily shown that
throughout the whole course of that trial the rules of the
Jewish law of procedure were grossly violated, and that the
accused was deprived of rights, belonging even to the meanest
citizen. He was arrested in the night, bound as a malefactor,
beaten before his arraignment, and struck in open court during
the trial; he was tried on a feast day, and before sunrise; he
was compelled to criminate himself, and this, under an oath or
solemn judicial adjuration; and he was sentenced on the same
day of the conviction. In all these particulars the law was
wholly disregarded.<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href="#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a>

years ago published at Paris, a work, entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“Histoire des
Institutions de Moïse et du Peuple Hébreu,”</span> in which, among
other things, he gives an account of their course of criminal
procedure, in a chapter on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Administration of Justice;”</span>
which he illustrates, in a succeeding chapter, by an account of
the trial of Jesus. As this is the recent work of a man of
learning, himself a Jew, it may be regarded as an authentic
statement of what is understood and held by the most intelligent
and best informed Jews, respecting the claims of our Lord,
the tenor of his doctrines, the nature of the charge laid against
him before the Sanhedrim, and the grounds on which they condemned
him. The following translation of the last-mentioned
chapter will therefore not be unacceptable to the reader. It
will be found in Book IV. chapter iii., entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Trial and
Condemnation of Jesus.”</span> The reader will bear in his mind,
that it is the language of an enemy of our Saviour, and in justification
of his murderers.

explained the motives which have directed me, and the point of
view in which I have considered the subject; I have already
shown, that among the Jews no title was a shelter against a
prosecution and sentence. Whether the law or its forms were
good or bad, is not the object of my present investigation;
neither is it to ascertain whether we ought to pity the blindness
of the Hebrews in not discovering a Deity in Jesus, or to be
astonished that a God personified could not make himself comprehended
when he desired it. But since they regarded him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page524">[pg 524]</span><a name="Pg524" id="Pg524" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only as a citizen, did they not try him according to their law
and its existing forms? This is my question, which can admit
of no equivocation. I shall draw all my facts from the Evangelists
themselves, without inquiring whether all this history
was developed after the event, to serve as a form to a new doctrine,
or to an old one which had received a fresh impulse.</span>

Jesus was born of a family of small fortune; Joseph, his
supposed father, perceived that his wife was big before they had
come together. If he had brought her to trial, in the ordinary
course of things, Mary, according to the 23rd verse of the 22nd
chapter of Deuteronomy, would have been condemned, and
Jesus, having been declared illegitimate, could never, according
to the 2nd verse of the 23rd chapter, have been admitted to a
seat in the Sanhedrim.<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a> But Joseph, who, to save his wife

After having been circumcised, Jesus grew like other men,
attended the solemn feasts, and early displayed surprising wisdom
and sagacity. In the assembly on the Sabbath, the Jews,
eager for the disputes to which the interpretation of the law

forms to those already promulgated, speaks of himself as God;

This was shocking blasphemy in the eyes of the citizens: the
law commands them to follow Jehovah alone, the only true
God; not to believe in gods of flesh and bone, resembling men

This decree is made public; it is known to all, especially to

liberty depends entirely upon himself. This is not all; the
order for his arrest was preceded by a decree of admonition.
One day, Jesus having entered the temple, took upon himself
authority contrary to the common law; then he preached to
the people, and said: <span class="tei tei-q">“That those who should believe in him

a nation, who, however they might have been deceived, yet
intended to act legally, should have permitted such outrages
against him whose life was at their disposal. The writers who
have transmitted to us these details, not having been present at
the trial, have been disposed to exaggerate the picture, either
on account of their prejudices, or to throw greater obloquy on
the judges.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
One thing is certain, that the council met again on the
morning of the next day or the day following that,<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a> as the law
requires, to confirm or to annul the sentence: it was confirmed.
Jesus was brought before Pilate, the procurator that the
Romans had placed over the Jews. They had retained the
power of trying according to their own laws, but the executive
power was in the hands of the procurator alone: no criminal
could be executed without his consent: this was in order that
the Senate should not have the means of reaching men who
were sold to foreigners.<a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a> Pilate, the Roman, signed the decree.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page529">[pg 529]</span><a name="Pg529" id="Pg529" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
His soldiers, an impure mixture of diverse nations, were charged
with the punishment. These are they who brought Jesus to
the judgment hall, who stripped him before the whole cohort,
who placed upon his head a crown of thorns, and a reed in his
hand, who showed all the barbarity to which the populace in all
ages is disposed; who finally caused him to undergo a punishment
common at Rome, and which was not in use among the
Jews.<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href="#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a> But before the execution, the governor had granted to
the condemned an appeal to the people, who, respecting the
judgment of their own council, would not permit this favour,
couching their refusal in these terms: <span class="tei tei-q">“We have a law; and
by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of
God.”</span><a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href="#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a> Then Pilate left them the choice of saving Jesus, or a
man accused of murder in a sedition; the people declared for
the latter; saying that the other would scatter the seeds of
discord in the bosom of the nation, at a time when union was
most necessary.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus was put to death. The priests and elders went to the
place of punishment; and as the sentence was founded upon
this fact, that he had unlawfully arrogated to himself the title
of Son of God, God himself, they appealed to him thus: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thou
wouldst save others; thyself thou canst not save. If thou art

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few years ago, Mr. Joseph Salvador, a physician—and a descendant of
one of those Jewish families, whom the intolerance of Ferdinand the Catholic
expelled, in a body, from Spain, about the year 1492—published at Paris a
learned work, entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Histoire des Institutions de Moïse et du Peuple
Hébreu,”</span> or History of the Institutions of Moses and the Hebrew People;
and in one chapter of his work he gives an account of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Administration of
Justice</span></span> among the Hebrews. To that chapter he has subjoined an account of
the <span class="tei tei-q">“Trial and Condemnation of Jesus;”</span> in the course of which he expresses
his opinion, that the trial, considered merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a legal proceeding</span></em>, was conformable
to the Jewish laws.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The author of the following little work, M. Dupin, who is one of the most
eminent lawyers of the French Bar, immediately called in question the correctness
of Mr. Salvador's opinion, and entered upon an analysis of this portion
of his work, with a view to examine its soundness, and the present volume
contains the result of that examination, conducted with great legal skill and
extensive learning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It appears, that he had, many years before, in a little work, entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
Free</span></span> Defence of Accused Persons,”</span> published in 1815, taken the same views
of this great trial; which, as he observes, has been justly called <span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Passion</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Suffering</span></span> of our Saviour; for he did in truth <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffer</span></em>, and had not a trial.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The author's attention, however, had been withdrawn from this subject for
several years, when it was again brought under his notice by the work of Mr.
Salvador, a copy of which was sent to him by that writer, with a request that
M. Dupin would give some account of it. Accordingly, says the latter, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is
in compliance with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his request</span></em>, and not from a spirit of hostility, that I have
made this examination of his work;”</span> and he gives ample proof of his good
feeling towards Mr. Salvador, with whom, he says, he is personally acquainted
and for whose talents he has a great respect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this friendly spirit he enters upon his examination; which is conducted
with an ability, learning, animation, and interest, that leave nothing to
be desired. As an argument, his work is unanswerable,—he has demolished
that of his adversary; and, for intense interest, we do not know any publication
of the present day to be compared with it.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page534">[pg 534]</span><a name="Pg534" id="Pg534" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The introductory <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Analysis</span></em> of Mr. Salvador's chapter on the Administration
of Justice according to the Jewish Law will be highly instructive and interesting;
and those persons, who have not been accustomed to read the Bible with
particular reference to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Law</span></em>, will find many new and striking views of that
portion of the Scriptures. They cannot fail to be particularly struck with the
extraordinary care taken to secure by law the personal liberty and rights of
the citizen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to Mr. Salvador's view, <span class="tei tei-q">“the fundamental division into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">castes</span></em> is
the principal basis of the oriental theocracies.”</span> Moses, on the contrary, took
for his basis the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity</span></em> of the people. In his system of legislation the people
are every thing; and the author shows us, that every thing, eventually, is
done for them, by them, and with them. The tribe of Levi was established,
only to supply a secondary want; and that tribe was very far from obtaining
all the powers which we are apt to attribute to it; it did not make, nor
develope the laws; it did not judge or govern; all its members, even the high
priest himself, were subject to the control of the Elders of the nation, or of
a Senate legally assembled.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Intimately connected with these rights of the people was the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">liberty of
speech</span></em>; and Mr. Salvador, in his chapter on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Public Orators and Prophets</span></span>,
maintains, and in the opinion of M. Dupin, proves clearly, that in no nation
was the liberty of speech ever so unlimited, as among the Hebrews. Accordingly
he observes—<span class="tei tei-q">“What an additional difference was this between the
Israelites and the Egyptians! Among the latter, the mass of the people did
not dare, without incurring the hazard of the most terrible punishment, to
utter a word on affairs of state; it was Harpocrates, the god of silence with
his finger on his closed lips, who was their God; in Israel, it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the right of
speech</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But we forbear any further reflections, and submit this remarkable performance
to our readers. Those, who are familiar with the animated tone of
French writers, will perhaps discover in this translation some loss of the fire
and intensity of the original; but the translator's purpose will be effected, if
his version shall be found to be a faithful one.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. Salvador has discussed with particular care whatever
relates to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">administration of justice</span></em> among the Jewish people.
We shall dwell upon this chapter, which undoubtedly will most
interest our readers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Judicare</span></span> and <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">judicari</span></span>, to judge and to be judged, express the
rights of every Hebrew citizen; that is, no one could be condemned
without a judgment, and every one might, in his turn,
be called upon to sit in judgment upon others. Some exceptions
to this principle are explained; but they do not affect
the rule. In matters of mere interest each party chose a judge,
and these two chose a third person. If a discussion arose as to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the interpretation of a law</span></em>, they carried it to the lower council of
Elders, and from thence to the Great council at Jerusalem.
Each town of more than one hundred and twenty families was
to have its lower council, consisting of twenty-three members;
and these had jurisdiction in criminal cases.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The expressions, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he shall die, he shall be cut off from the people</span></span>,
which are so often used in the Mosaic law, embrace three very
different significations, which we are accustomed to confound.
They indicate the suffering of death as a punishment, civil
death, and that premature death, with which an individual is
naturally threatened, who departs from those rules which are
useful to the nation and to the individual himself. Civil death
is the last degree of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">separation</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">excommunication</span></span>; it is pronounced,
as a judicial punishment, by the assembly of the judges.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page536">[pg 536]</span><a name="Pg536" id="Pg536" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There were three kinds of separation; which Mr. Salvador
compares to the three degrees of civil excommunication provided
for in the French Penal Code, and which condemn the criminal
to hard labour either for life or for a term of years, or to certain
correctional punishments. But the Hebrew excommunication
had this advantage, that the party <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never lost all hope of regaining
his original standing</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Hebrew lawyers, in relation to the punishment of death,
maintained opinions, which deserve to be quoted:—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“A tribunal, which condemns to death <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">once in seven years</span></em>,
may be called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sanguinary</span></span>.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“It deserves this appellation, says
doctor Eliezer, when it pronounces a like sentence once in
seventy years.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“If we had been members of the high court,
say the doctors Tyrphon and Akiba, we should never have condemned
a man to death.”</span> Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, replied—<span class="tei tei-q">“Would
not that be an abuse? Would you not have
been afraid of multiplying crimes in Israel?”</span> Mr. Salvador
answers—<span class="tei tei-q">“No, certainly; far from lessening their number, the
severity of the punishment increases it, by giving a more resolute
character to the men who are able to brave it; and, at the
present day, how many intelligent minds range themselves on
the side of Akiba and Tyrphon! How many consciences refuse
to participate, in any manner, in the death of a man! The
flowing of blood, the multitude excited by an unbecoming
curiosity, the victim dragged in triumph to the horrible altar,
the impossibility of repairing a mistake, (from which human
wisdom is never exempt), the dread of one day seeing a departed
shade rising up and saying, <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I was innocent</span></span>,’</span> the facility which
modern nations have of expelling from among them the man
whose presence pollutes them—the influence of general depravity
on the production of crimes—and finally the absurd contrast of
the whole of society, while in possession of strength, intelligence,
and arms, opposing itself to an individual wretch (who has been
drawn on by want, by passion, or by ignorance) and yet finding
no other means of redress than by exceeding him in cruelty—all
these things, and many others, have so deeply penetrated the
minds of all ranks of people, that there will one day proceed
from them the most striking proof of the power of morals over
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page537">[pg 537]</span><a name="Pg537" id="Pg537" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the laws; for the law will be changed by the simple fact, that
we shall not find any person who will consent to apply it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I feel honoured in having maintained the same opinion in my
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Observations on Criminal Legislation</span></span>; but I solicit those, who
wish to see this question discussed in its whole extent, to read
the profound reflections which the Duke de Broglie has just
published on the subject, in the last number of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revue
Française</span></span> (for October, 1828.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The whole criminal procedure in the Pentateuch rests upon
three principles, which may be thus expressed; publicity of the
trial, entire liberty of defence allowed to the accused; and a
guaranty against the dangers of testimony. According to the
Hebrew text <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> witness is no witness; there must be at least
two or three who know the fact. The witness, who testifies
against a man, must swear that he speaks the truth; the judges
then proceed to take exact information of the matter; and, if it
is found that the witness has sworn falsely, they compel him
to undergo the punishment to which he would have exposed his
neighbour. The discussion between the accuser and the accused
is conducted before the whole assembly of the people. When a
man is condemned to death, those witnesses whose evidence
decided the sentence inflict the first blows, in order to add the
last degree of certainty to their evidence. Hence the expression—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Let
him among you, who is without sin, cast the first stone</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If we pursue their application of these fundamental rules in
practice, we shall find that a trial proceeded in the following
manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the day of the trial, the executive officers of justice caused
the accused person to make his appearance. At the feet of the
Elders were placed men who, under the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">auditors</span></span>, or
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">candidates</span></span>, followed regularly the sittings of the Council. The
papers in the case were read; and the witnesses were called in
succession. The president addressed this exhortation to each of
them: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not conjectures, or whatever public rumour has
brought to thee, that we ask of thee; consider that a great
responsibility rests upon thee: that we are not occupied by an
affair, like a case of pecuniary interest, in which the injury may
be repaired. If thou causest the condemnation of a person unjustly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page538">[pg 538]</span><a name="Pg538" id="Pg538" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
accused, his blood, and the blood of all the posterity of
him, of whom thou wilt have deprived the earth, will fall upon
thee; God will demand of thee an account, as he demanded of
Cain an account of the blood of Abel. Speak.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A woman could not be a witness, because she would not have
the courage to give the first blow to the condemned person;
nor could a child, that is irresponsible, nor a slave, nor a man
of bad character, nor one whose infirmities prevent the full
enjoyment of his physical and moral faculties. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The simple confession
of an individual against himself</span></em>, or the declaration of a
prophet, however renowned, would not decide a condemnation.
The Doctors say—<span class="tei tei-q">“We hold it as fundamental, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no one shall
prejudice himself</span></em>. If a man accuses himself before a tribunal,
we must not believe him, unless the fact is attested by two other
witnesses; and it is proper to remark, that the punishment of
death inflicted upon Achan, in the time of Joshua<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href="#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a> was an exception,
occasioned by the nature of the circumstances; for our
law does not condemn upon the simple confession of the accused,
nor upon the declaration of one prophet alone.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The witnesses were to attest to the identity of the party, and
to depose to the month, day, hour, and circumstances of the
crime. After an examination of the proofs, those judges who
believed the party innocent stated their reasons; those who
believed him guilty spoke afterwards, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with the greatest
moderation</span></em>. If one of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">auditors</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">candidates</span></em>, was entrusted
by the accused with his defence, or if he wished in his own name
to present any elucidations in favour of innocence, he was
admitted to the seat, from which he addressed the judges and
the people. But this liberty was not granted to him, if his
opinion was in favour of condemning. Lastly; when the accused
person himself wished to speak, they gave the most profound
attention. When the discussion was finished, one of the judges
recapitulated the case; they removed all the spectators; two
scribes took down the votes of the judges; one of them noted
those which were in favour of the accused, and the other, those
which condemned him. Eleven votes, out of twenty-three, were
sufficient to acquit; but it required thirteen to convict. If any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page539">[pg 539]</span><a name="Pg539" id="Pg539" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the judges stated that they were not sufficiently informed,
there were added two more Elders, and then two others in succession,
till they formed a council of sixty-two, which was the
number of the Grand Council. If a majority of votes acquitted,
the accused was discharged <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">instantly</span></em>; if he was to be punished,
the judges postponed pronouncing sentence till the third day;
during the intermediate day they could not be occupied with
anything but the cause, and they abstained from eating freely,
and from wine, liquors, and everything which might render
their minds less capable of reflection.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the morning of the third day they returned to the
judgment seat. Each judge, who had not changed his opinion,
said, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I continue of the same opinion and condemn</span></span>; any one, who
at first condemned, might at this sitting acquit; but he who
had once acquitted was not allowed to condemn. If a majority
condemned, two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magistrates</span></em> immediately accompanied the
condemned person to the place of punishment. The Elders did
not descend from their seats; they placed at the entrance of the
judgment hall an officer of justice with a small flag in his hand;
a second officer, on horseback, followed the prisoner, and
constantly kept looking back to the place of departure. During
this interval, if any person came to announce to the Elders any
new evidence favourable to the prisoner, the first officer waved
his flag, and the second one, as soon as he perceived it, brought
back the prisoner. If the prisoner declared to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">magistrates</span></em>,
that he recollected some reasons which had escaped him, they
brought him before the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">judges</span></em> no less than five times. If no
incident occurred, the procession advanced slowly, preceded by
a herald who, in a loud voice, addressed the people thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“This
man (stating his name and surname) is led to punishment for
such a crime; the witnesses who have sworn against him are
such and such persons; if any one has evidence to give in his
favour, let him come forth quickly.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was in consequence of this rule that the youthful Daniel
caused the procession to go back, which was leading Susanna to
punishment, and he himself ascended the seat of justice to put
some new questions to the witnesses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At some distance from the place of punishment, they urged
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page540">[pg 540]</span><a name="Pg540" id="Pg540" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

less terrible.<a id="noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href="#note_400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a>

By this mere analysis of a part of Mr. Salvador's work we
may judge of the extreme interest of the whole. His principal
object has been, to make apparent the mutual aids which history,
philosophy, and legislation afford in explaining the institutions of
the Jewish people. His book is a scientific work, and at the same
time a work of taste. His notes indicate vast reading; and in
the choice of his citations he gives proofs of his critical skill and
discrimination. Mr. Salvador belongs, by his age, to that new
generation, which is distinguished as much by its application to
solid studies, as by elevation and generosity of sentiment.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The chapter, in which Mr. Salvador treats of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Administration
of Justice among the Hebrews</span></span>, is altogether theoretical.
He makes an exposition of the law—that things, in order to be
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">conformable to rule</span></span>, must be transacted in a certain mode. In
all this I have not contradicted him, but have let him speak for
himself.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the subsequent chapter the author announces: <span class="tei tei-q">“That
according to this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">exposition of judicial proceedings</span></span> he is going to
follow out the application of them to the most memorable trial
in all history, that of Jesus Christ.”</span> Accordingly the chapter
is entitled: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Trial and Condemnation of Jesus</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The author first takes care to inform us under what point of
view he intends to give an account of that accusation: <span class="tei tei-q">“That
we ought to lament the blindness of the Hebrews for not having
recognised a God in Jesus, is a point which I do not examine.”</span>
(There is another thing also, which he says he shall not examine.)
<span class="tei tei-q">“But, when they discovered in him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">only a citizen</span></span>, did they try
him <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">according to existing laws and formalities</span></span>?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question being thus stated, Mr. Salvador goes over all
the various aspects of the accusation; and his conclusion is, that
the procedure was perfectly regular, and the condemnation
perfectly appropriate to the act committed. <span class="tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> says he,
(p. 87,) <span class="tei tei-q">“the Senate, having adjudged that Jesus, the son of
Joseph, born in Bethlehem, had profaned the name of God
by usurping it himself, though a simple citizen, applied to him
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page542">[pg 542]</span><a name="Pg542" id="Pg542" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the law against blasphemy, the law in the 13th chapter of
Deuteronomy, and verse 20, chapter 18th, conformably to which
every prophet, even one that performs miracles, is to be punished
when he speaks of a God unknown to the Hebrews or their
fathers.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This conclusion is formed to please the followers of the
Jewish law; it is wholly for their benefit, and the evident object
is, to justify them from the reproach of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">deïcide</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will, however, avoid treating this grave subject in a
theological point of view. As to myself, Jesus Christ is the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Man-God</span></span>; but it is not with arguments drawn from my religion
and my creed, that I intend to combat the statement and the
conclusion of Mr. Salvador. The present age would charge me
with being intolerant; and this is a reproach which I will never
incur. Besides, I do not wish to give to the enemies of
Christianity the advantage of making the outcry, that we are
afraid to enter into a discussion with them, and that we wish to
crush rather than to convince them. Having thus contented
myself with declaring my own faith, as Mr. Salvador has let us
clearly understand his, I shall also examine the question under
a merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human</span></em> point of view, and proceed to inquire, with him,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Whether Jesus Christ, considered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a simple citizen</span></em>, was
tried according to the existing laws and formalities.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The catholic religion itself warrants me in this; it is not a
mere fiction; for God willed, that Jesus should be clothed in
the forms of humanity (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et homo factus est</span></span>), and that he should
undergo the lot and sufferings of humanity. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">son of God</span></span>,
as to his moral state and his holy spirit, he was also, in reality,
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Son of Man</span></span>, for the purpose of accomplishing the mission
which he came upon earth to fulfil.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This being the state of the question, then, I enter upon my
subject; and I do not hesitate to affirm, because I will prove it,
that, upon examining all the circumstances of this great trial,
we shall be very far from discovering in it the application of
those legal maxims, which are the safeguard of the rights of
accused persons, and of which Mr. Salvador, in his chapter <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On
the Administration of Justice</span></span>, has made a seductive exposition.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The accusation of Jesus, instigated by the hatred of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page543">[pg 543]</span><a name="Pg543" id="Pg543" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
priests and the Pharisees, and presented at first as a charge of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sacrilege</span></span>, but afterwards converted into a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">political</span></span> crime and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">an
offence against the state</span></span>, was marked, in all its aspects, with the
foulest acts of violence and perfidy. It was not so much <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a trial</span></em>
environed with legal forms, as a real <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passion</span></em>, or prolonged
suffering, in which the imperturbable gentleness of the victim
displays more strongly the unrelenting ferocity of his persecutors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Jesus appeared among the Jews, that people was but
the shadow of itself. Broken down by more than one subjugation,
divided by factions and irreconcilable sects, they had in
the last resort been obliged to succumb to the Roman power
and surrender their own sovereignty. Jerusalem, having
become a mere appendage to the province of Syria, saw within
its walls an imperial garrison; Pilate commanded there, in the
name of Cæsar; and the late people of God were groaning
under the double tyranny of a conqueror, whose power they
abhorred and whose idolatry they detested, and of a priesthood
that exerted itself to keep them under the rigorous bonds of a
religious fanaticism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus Christ deplored the misfortunes of his country. How
often did he weep for Jerusalem! Read in Bossuet's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Politics
drawn from the Holy Scriptures</span></span>, the admirable chapter entitled,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Christ the good citizen</span></span>. He recommended to his countrymen
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">union</span></em>, which constitutes the strength of states. <span class="tei tei-q">“O
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, (said he,) thou that killest the prophets
and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I
have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth
her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was supposed to be not favorable to the Romans; but he
only loved his own countrymen more. Witness the address of
the Jews, who, in order to induce him to restore to the centurion
a sick servant that was dear to him, used as the most powerful
argument these words—that he was worthy for whom he should
do this, for he loveth our nation. And Jesus went with them.
Luke vii. 4, 5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Touched with the distresses of the nation, Jesus comforted
them by holding up to them the hope of another life; he
alarmed the great, the rich, and the haughty, by the prospect of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page544">[pg 544]</span><a name="Pg544" id="Pg544" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a final judgment, at which every man would be judged not
according to his rank, but his works. He was desirous of again
bringing back man to his original dignity; he spoke to him of
his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duties</span></em>, but at the same time of his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rights</span></em>. The people heard
him with avidity, and followed him with eagerness; his words
affected them; his hand healed their diseases, and his moral
teaching instructed them; he preached, and practised one virtue
till then unknown, and which belongs to him alone—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">charity</span></em>.
This celebrity, however, and these wonders excited envy. The
partisans of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ancient theocracy</span></em> were alarmed at the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new
doctrine</span></em>; the chief priests felt that their power was threatened;
the pride of the Pharisees was humbled; the scribes came in as
their auxiliaries, and the destruction of Jesus was resolved upon.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, if his conduct was reprehensible, if it afforded grounds
for a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">legal accusation</span></em>, why was not that course taken openly?
Why not try him for the acts committed by him, and for his
public discourses? Why employ against him subterfuges,
artifice, perfidy, and violence? for such was the mode of proceeding
against Jesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now take up the subject, and look at the narratives
which have come down to us. Let us, with Mr. Salvador, open
the books of the Gospels; for he does not object to that testimony;
nay, he relies upon it: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is by the Gospels themselves,”</span>
says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“that I shall establish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the facts</span></em>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In truth, how can we (except by contrary evidence, of which
there is none) refuse to place confidence in an historian, who tells
us, as Saint John does, with affecting simplicity: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that saw
it bare record, and his record is true, and he knoweth that he
saith true, that ye might believe.”</span> John xix. 35.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Section I.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spies, or Informers</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Who will not be surprised to find in this case the odious
practice of employing hired informers? Branded with infamy,
as they are in modern times, they will be still more so when we
carry back their origin to the trial of Christ. It will be seen
presently, whether I have not properly characterized by the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page545">[pg 545]</span><a name="Pg545" id="Pg545" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
name of hired informers those emissaries, whom the chief priests
sent out to be about Jesus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We read in the evangelist Luke, chap. xx. 20: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Et observantes
miserunt insidiatores, qui se justos simularent, ut caperent eum in
sermone, et traderent illum principatui et potestati præsidis</span></span>. I will
not translate this text myself, but will take the language of a
translator whose accuracy is well known, Mr. De Sacy: <span class="tei tei-q">“As
they only sought occasions for his destruction, they sent to him
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">apostate persons who feigned themselves just men</span></span>, in order to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">take
hold</span></span> of his words, that they might deliver him unto magistrate
and into the power of the governor.”</span> And Mr. De Sacy
adds—<span class="tei tei-q">“if there should escape from him the least word against
the public authorities.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This first artifice has escaped the sagacity of Mr. Salvador.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Section II.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Corruption and Treachery of Judas</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
According to Mr. Salvador, the senate, as he calls it, did not
commence their proceedings by arresting Jesus, as would be
done at the present day; but they began by passing a preliminary
decree, that he should be arrested; and he cites, in proof
of his assertion, St. John xi. 53, 54, and St. Matthew xxvi. 4, 5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But St. John says nothing of this pretended decree. He
speaks, too, not of a public sitting, but of a consultation held
by the chief priests and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pharisees</span></span>, who did not, to my knowledge,
constitute a judicial tribunal among the Jews. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then
gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said,
What do we? for this man <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">doeth many miracles</span></span>.”</span> John xi. 47.
They add: <span class="tei tei-q">“If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on
him,”</span>—which imported also, in their minds, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and they will no
longer believe in us</span></span>. Now, in this, I can readily perceive the
fear of seeing the morals and doctrines of Jesus prevail; but
where is the preliminary <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judgment</span></span>, or decree? I cannot discover
it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest
that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page546">[pg 546]</span><a name="Pg546" id="Pg546" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
consider, that it is expedient for us, that one man should die
for the people ... and he <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prophesied</span></span>, that Jesus should die
for the nation of the Jews.”</span> But to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prophesy</span></span> is not to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pass
judgment</span></span>; and the individual opinion of Caiaphas, who was only
one among them, was not the opinion of all, nor a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judgment of
the senate</span></span>. We, therefore, still find a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judgment</span></span> wanting; and
we only observe, that the priests and Pharisees are stimulated
by a violent hatred of Jesus, and that <span class="tei tei-q">“from that day forth they
took counsel together for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to put him to death; ut interficerent
eum</span></span>.”</span> John xi. 53.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The authority of St. John, then, is directly in contradiction
of the assertion, that there was an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">order of arrest</span></span> previously
passed by a regular tribunal.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. Matthew, in relating the same facts, says, that the chief
priests assembled at the palace of the high priest, who was called
Caiaphas, and there held counsel together. But what counsel?
and what was the result of it? Was it to issue an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">order of arrest</span></span> against Jesus, that they might hear him and then pass sentence?
Not at all; but they held counsel together, <span class="tei tei-q">“that they might
take Jesus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">by subtilty</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fraud</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kill him</span></span>”</span>; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concilium fecerunt</span></span>,

Latin language, a language perfectly well constituted in everything
relating to terms of the law, the words <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">occidere</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">interficere</span></span>
were never employed to express the act of passing <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sentence</span></span>,
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judgment of death</span></span>, but simply to signify <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">murder</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">assassination</span></span>.<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fraud</span></em>, by the aid of which they were to get Jesus into
their power, was nothing but the bargain made between the
chief priests and Judas.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Judas, one of the twelve, goes to find the chief priests, and
says to them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto
you? Matt. xxvi. 14, 15. And they covenanted with him for
thirty pieces of silver! Jesus, who foresaw his treachery, warned
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page547">[pg 547]</span><a name="Pg547" id="Pg547" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him of it mildly, in the midst of the Last Supper, where the voice
of his master, in the presence of his brethren, should have
touched him and awakened his reflections! But not so; wholly
absorbed in his reward, Judas placed himself at the head of a
gang of servants, to whom he was to point out Jesus; and, then,
by a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kiss</span></em> consummated his treachery!<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is it thus that a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">judicial decree was to be executed</span></em>, if there
had really been one made for the arrest of Jesus?

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The act was done in the night time. After having celebrated
the Supper, Jesus had conducted his disciples to the Mount of
Olives. He prayed fervently; but they fell asleep.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus awakes them, with a gentle reproof for their weakness,
and warns them that the moment is approaching. <span class="tei tei-q">“Rise, let

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Judas was not alone; in his suite there was a kind of ruffian
band, almost entirely composed of servants of the high priest,
but whom Mr. Salvador honours with the title of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">legal
soldiery</span></em>. If in the crowd there were any Roman <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">soldiers</span></em>, they
were there as spectators, and without having been legally called
on duty; for the Roman commanding officer, Pilate, had not
yet heard the affair spoken of.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This personal seizure of Jesus had so much the appearance
of a forcible arrest, an illegal act of violence, that his disciples
made preparation to repel force by force.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Malchus, the insolent servant of the high priest, having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page548">[pg 548]</span><a name="Pg548" id="Pg548" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shown himself the most eager to rush upon Jesus, Peter, not
less zealous for his own master, cut off the servant's right ear.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This resistance might have been continued with success, if
Jesus had not immediately interfered. But what proves that
Peter, even while causing bloodshed, was not resisting a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">legal
order</span></em>, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">legal judgment</span></em> or decree, (which would have made his
resistance an act of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rebellion by an armed force against a judicial
order</span></em>,) is this—that he was not arrested, either at the moment
or afterwards, at the house of the high priest, to which he followed
Jesus, and where he was most distinctly recognised by
the maid servant of the high priest, and even by a relative of
Malchus.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus alone was arrested; and although he had not individually
offered any active resistance, and had even restrained that
of his disciples, they bound him as a malefactor; which was a
criminal degree of rigour, since for the purpose of securing a
single man by a numerous band of persons armed with swords
and staves it was not necessary. <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye come out as against
a thief with swords and staves?”</span> Luke xxii. 52.

They dragged Jesus along with them; and, instead of taking
him directly to the proper magistrate, they carried him before

for the purpose of letting him be seen by him, such a curiosity
was not to be gratified; it was a vexatious proceeding, an irregularity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the house of Annas they led him to that of the high
priest; all this time being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bound</span></em>. John xviii. 24. They placed
him in the court yard; it was cold, and they made a fire; it
was in the night time, but by the light of the fire Peter was

Under this state of things, his person being forcibly seized
and detained in a private house, and delivered into the hands of
servants, in the midst of a court, how was Jesus treated? St.
Luke says, the men that held Jesus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mocked</span></span> him and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">smote</span></span> him;
and when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the

thee? And many other things blasphemously spake they
against him. Luke xxii. 63, 64, 65.

Already had the cock crowed! But it was not yet day.
The elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes
came together, and, having caused Jesus to appear before their
council, they proceeded to interrogate him. Luke xxii. 66.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, in the outset, it should be observed, that if they had
been less carried away by their hatred, they should, as it was the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">night time</span></span>, not only have postponed, but put a stop to the proceedings,
because it was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the feast of the Passover</span></span>, the most
solemn of all festivals; and according to their law no <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judicial

being null.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href="#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a> Nevertheless, let us see who proceeded to interrogate
Jesus. This was that same Caiaphas, who, if he had
intended to remain a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judge</span></span>, was evidently liable to objection;
for in the preceding assemblage he had made himself the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">accuser</span></span>
of Jesus.<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> Even before he had seen or heard him, he declared
him to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">deserving of death</span></span>. He said to his colleagues, that <span class="tei tei-q">“it
was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">expedient</span></span> that one man should die for all.”</span> John xviii. 14.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page550">[pg 550]</span><a name="Pg550" id="Pg550" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Such being the opinion of Caiaphas, we shall not be surprised,
if he shows partiality.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instead of interrogating Jesus respecting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">positive acts done</span></em>,
with their circumstances, and respecting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facts personal to himself</span></em>,
Caiaphas interrogates him respecting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general facts</span></em>, respecting
his disciples (whom it would have been much more simple to
have called as witnesses), and respecting his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">doctrine</span></em>, which was
a mere abstraction so long as no external acts were the consequence
of it. <span class="tei tei-q">“The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples
and of his doctrine.”</span> John xviii. 19.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus answered with dignity: <span class="tei tei-q">“I spake openly to the world;
I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple, whither the
Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.”</span> Ib. 20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Why askest thou me? Ask them which heard me, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">what I

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which
stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying,
Answerest thou the high priest so?”</span> Ib. 22.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Will it here be still said, that this violence was the individual
act of the person who thus struck the accused? I answer, that
on this occasion the fact took place in the presence and under
the eyes of the whole council; and, as the high priest who
presided did not restrain the author of it, I come to the conclusion,
that he became an accomplice, especially when this
violence was committed under the pretence of avenging the
alleged affront to his dignity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in what respect could the answer of Jesus appear offensive?
<span class="tei tei-q">“If I have spoken evil,”</span> said Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“bear witness of the
evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?”</span><a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href="#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a> John xviii. 23.

There remained no mode of escaping from this dilemma.
They accused Jesus; it was for those, who accused, to prove
their accusation. An accused person is not obliged to criminate
himself. He should have been convicted by proofs; he himself
called for them. Let us see what witnesses were produced
against him.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. Salvador, on this subject, says, p. 87: <span class="tei tei-q">“The two witnesses,
whom St. Matthew and St. Mark charge with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">falsehood</span></em>,
narrate a discourse which St. John declares to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>, so far
as respects the power which Jesus Christ attributed to himself.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This alleged contradiction among the Evangelists does not
exist. In the first place, St. Matthew does not say that the
discourse was had by Jesus. In chapter xxvi. 61, he states the
depositions of the witnesses, but saying at the same time that
they were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">false witnesses</span></em>; and in chapter xxvii. 40, he puts the
same declaration into the mouth of those who insulted Jesus at
the foot of the cross; but he does not put it into the mouth
of Christ. He is in accordance with St. Mark.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
St. John, chapter ii. 19, makes Jesus speak in these words:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and
in three days I will raise it up.”</span> And St. John adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“He
spake of the temple of his body.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus Jesus did not say in an affirmative and somewhat
menacing manner, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I will destroy this temple</span></span>, as the witnesses
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">falsely</span></em> assumed; he only said, hypothetically, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Destroy this
temple</span></span>, that is to say, suppose this temple should be destroyed,
I will raise it up in three days. Besides, they could not
dissemble, that he referred to a temple altogether different
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page552">[pg 552]</span><a name="Pg552" id="Pg552" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from theirs, because he said, I will raise up another in three
days, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">which will not be made by the hands of man</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It hence results, at least, that the Jews did not understand
him, for they cried out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Forty and six years was this temple
in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, then, the witnesses did not agree together, and their
declarations had nothing conclusive. Mark xiv. 59. We must,
therefore, look for other proofs.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then the high priest, (we must not forget, that he is still
the accuser,) the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked
Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it, which these
witness against thee? But he held his peace, and answered
nothing.”</span> Mark xiv. 60. In truth, since the question was not
concerning the temple of the Jews, but an ideal temple, not made
by the hand of man, and which was alone in the thoughts of Jesus,
the explanation was to be found in the very evidence itself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The high priest continued: <span class="tei tei-q">“I adjure thee, by the living God,
that thou tell us, whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.”</span>
Matt. xxvi. 63. I adjure thee, I call upon thee on oath! a
gross infraction of that rule of morals and jurisprudence, which
forbids our placing an accused person between the danger of
perjury and the fear of inculpating himself, and thus making
his situation more hazardous. The high priest, however, persists,
and says to him: Art thou the Christ, the Son of God?<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href="#note_406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a>

Mark xiv. 62.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He hath spoken

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ye have heard his blasphemy</span></span>. What think ye? They answered
and said, He is guilty of death.”</span> Matt. xxvi. 66.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now compare this scene of violence with the mild
deduction of principles, which we find in the chapter of Mr.
Salvador <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the Administration of Justice</span></span>; and let us ask ourselves,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page553">[pg 553]</span><a name="Pg553" id="Pg553" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
if, as he alleges, we find a just <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">application</span></em> of them in the
proceedings against Christ?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Do we discover here that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">respect</span></em> of the Hebrew judge towards
the party accused, when we see that Caiaphas permitted him to
be struck, in his presence, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with impunity</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What was this Caiaphas, at once an accuser and judge?<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href="#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a> A
passionate man, and too much resembling the odious portrait
which the historian Josephus has given us of him!<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> A judge, who
was irritated to such a degree, that he rent his clothes; who imposed
upon the accused a most solemn oath, and who gave to his
answers the criminal character, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he had spoken</span></span> blasphemy!
And, from that moment, he wanted no more witnesses, notwithstanding
the law required them. He would not have an inquiry,
which he perceived would be insufficient; he attempts to supply
it by captious questions. He is desirous of having him condemned
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">upon his own declaration alone</span></em>, (interpreted, too, as he chooses to
understand it,) though that was forbidden by the laws of the
Hebrews! And, in the midst of a most violent transport of
passion, this accuser himself, a high priest, who means to speak
in the name of the living God, is the first to pass sentence of
death, and carries with him the opinions of the rest!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this hideous picture I cannot recognise that justice of the
Hebrews, of which Mr. Salvador has given so fine a view in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his
theory</span></em>!

Section VII.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Subsequent Acts of Violence</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Immediately after this kind of sacerdotal verdict rendered
against Jesus, the acts of violence and insults recommenced
with increased strength; the fury of the judge must have communicated
itself to the bystanders. St. Matthew says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Then
did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote
him with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto us,
thou Christ; who is he that smote thee?”</span> Matt. xxvi. 67, 68.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page554">[pg 554]</span><a name="Pg554" id="Pg554" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. Salvador does not contest the truth of this ill treatment.
In page 88 he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“It was contrary to the spirit of the Hebrew
law, and that it was not according to the order of nature, that a
senate composed of the most respectable men of a nation,—that
a senate, which might perhaps be mistaken, but which thought
it was acting mildly, should have permitted such outrages
against him whose life it held in its own hands. The writers
who have transmitted these details to us, not having been present
themselves at the trial, were disposed to overcharge the picture,
either on account of their own feelings, or to throw upon their
judges a greater odium.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I repeat; this ill treatment was entirely contrary to the spirit
of the law. And what do I want more, since my object is to
make prominent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the violations of law</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is not in nature to see a body, which respects itself,
authorize such attempts.”</span> But of what consequence is that,
when the fact is established? <span class="tei tei-q">“The historians, it is said, were
not present at the trial.”</span> But was Mr. Salvador there present
himself, so that he could give a flat denial of their statements?
And when even an able writer, who was not an eye-witness,
relates the same events after the lapse of more than eighteen
centuries, he ought at least to bring opposing evidence, if he
would impeach that of contemporaries; who, if they were not
in the very hall of the council, were certainly on the spot, in
the vicinity, perhaps in the court yard, inquiring anxiously of
every thing that was happening to the man whose disciples they
were.<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a> Besides, the learned author whom I am combating says,
in the outset (p. 81), <span class="tei tei-q">“it is from the Gospels themselves that he
will take all his facts.”</span> He must then take the whole together,
as well those which go to condemn, as those which are in palliation
or excuse.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those gross insults, those inhuman acts of violence, even if
they are to be cast upon the servants of the high priest and the
persons in his train, do not excuse those individuals, who, when
they took upon themselves the authority of judges, were bound
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page555">[pg 555]</span><a name="Pg555" id="Pg555" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at the same time to throw around him all the protection of the
law. Caiaphas, too, was culpable as the master of the house
(for every thing took place in his house), even if he should not
be responsible as high priest and president of the council for
having permitted excesses, which, indeed were but too much in
accordance with the rage he had himself displayed upon the
bench.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These outrages, which would be inexcusable even towards a
man irrevocably condemned to punishment, were the more
criminal towards Jesus, because, legally and judicially speaking,
there had not yet been any sentence properly passed against
him according to the public law of the country; as we shall
see in the following section, which will deserve the undivided
attention of the reader.

What then was the right of the Jewish authorities in regard
to Jesus? Without doubt the scribes, and their friends the
Pharisees, might well have been alarmed, as a body and
individually, at the preaching and success of Jesus; they
might be concerned for their worship; and they might have
interrogated the man respecting his creed and his doctrines,—they
might have made a kind of preparatory proceeding,—they
might have declared, in point of fact, that those doctrines,
which threatened their own, were contrary to their law, as

But that law, although it had not undergone any alteration

they have undertaken to pronounce sentence of death under the

not the power to pass a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sentence of death</span></em>; it only would have
had power to make <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an accusation</span></em> against him before the
governor, or his deputy, and then deliver him over to be tried
by him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us distinctly establish this point; for here I entirely
differ in opinion from Mr. Salvador. According to him,
(p. 88), <span class="tei tei-q">“the Jews had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reserved the power of trying, according
to their law</span></em>; but it was in the hands of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">procurator</span></span> alone,
that the executive power was vested; every culprit must be put
to death by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> consent, in order that the senate should not
have the means of reaching persons that were sold to foreigners.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No; the Jews had not reserved <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the right of passing sentence
of death</span></em>. This right had been transferred to the Romans by
the very act of conquest; and this was not merely that the
senate should not have the means of reaching persons who were
sold to foreign countries; but it was done, in order that the
conqueror might be able to reach those individuals who should
become <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impatient of the yoke</span></em>; it was, in short, for the equal
protection of all, as all had become Roman subjects; and to
Rome alone belonged the highest judicial power, which is the
principal attribute of sovereignty. Pilate, as the representative
of Cæsar in Judea, was not merely an agent of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">executive
authority</span></em>, which would have left the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">judiciary</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">legislative</span></em>
power in the hands of the conquered people—he was not simply
an officer appointed to give an <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">exequatur</span></span> or mere approval
(<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">visa</span></span>) to sentences passed by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another authority</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">authority of
the Jews</span></em>. When the matter in question was a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">capital</span></em> case,
the Roman authorities not only ordered the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">execution</span></em> of a
sentence, but also took cognizance (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">cognitio</span></span>) of the crime; it
had the right of jurisdiction <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">à priori</span></span>, and that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passing
judgment in the last resort</span></em>. If Pilate himself had not had this
power by special delegation, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">vice præsidis</span></span>, it was vested in the
governor, within whose territorial jurisdiction the case occurred;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page558">[pg 558]</span><a name="Pg558" id="Pg558" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but in any event we hold it to be clear, that the Jews had lost
the right of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">condemning to death</span></em> any person whatever, not only
so far as respects the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">execution</span></em> but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passing</span></em> of the sentence.
This is one of the best settled points in the provincial law of
the Romans.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Jews were not ignorant of this; for when they went
before Pilate, to ask of him the condemnation of Jesus, they
themselves declared, that it was not permitted to them to put
any person to death: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not lawful for us to put any man to
death.”</span> John xviii. 31.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here I am happy to be able to support myself by the opinion
of a very respectable authority, the celebrated Loiseau, in his
treatise on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seigneuries</span></span>, in the chapter on the administration of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">justice belonging to cities</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“In truth,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“there is
some evidence, that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">police</span></em>, in which the people had the
sole interest, was administered by officers of the people; but I
know not upon what were founded the concessions of power to
some cities of France to exercise criminal jurisdiction; nor why
the Ordinance of Moulins left that to them rather than civil
cases; for the criminal jurisdiction is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right of the sword</span></em>, the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">merum imperium</span></span>, or absolute sovereignty. Accordingly, by the
Roman law, the administration of justice was so far prohibited
to the officers of cities, that they could not punish even by a
simple fine. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thus it is doubtless that we must understand</span></em> that
passage of the Gospel, where the Jews say to Pilate, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It is not
lawful for us to put any man to death</span></span>; for, after they were subjected
to the Romans, they had not jurisdiction of crimes.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At this point I must entreat the particular attention of the
reader. The irregularities and acts of violence, which I have
hitherto remarked upon, are nothing in comparison with the
unbridled fury, which is about to display itself before the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman
Judge</span></em>, in order to extort from him, against his own conviction,
a sentence of death.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-q">“And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
consultation with the elders, and scribes, and the whole council,
and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">As soon as the morning was come</span></span>; for, as I have observed
already, every thing which had been done thus far against Jesus

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They then led Jesus from Caiaphas unto the Hall of Judgment
of Pilate.<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href="#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a> It was early; and they themselves went not
into the judgment hall, lest <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">they should be defiled</span></span>; but that
they might eat the passover. John xviii. 28.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Singular scrupulousness! and truly worthy of the Pharisees!
They were afraid of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">defiling themselves on the day of the passover</span></em>
by entering <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the house of</span></em> a heathen! And yet, the same day,
only some hours before presenting themselves to Pilate, they
had, in contempt of their own law, committed the outrage of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">holding a council</span></em> and deliberating upon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an accusation of a capital
crime</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As they would not enter, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pilate went out to them.”</span> John
xviii. 29. Now observe his language. He did not say to them,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Where is the sentence you have passed</span></span>; as he must have done, if
he was only to give them his simple <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">exequatur</span></span>, or permission to
execute the sentence; but he takes up the matter from the
beginning, as would be done by one who had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plenary jurisdiction</span></em>;
and he says to them: What accusation bring ye against
this man?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They answered, with their accustomed haughtiness: If he
were not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a malefactor</span></span> we would not have delivered him up to
thee. John xviii. 30. They wished to have it understood, that,
being a question of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">blasphemy</span></span>, it was the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">cause of their religion</span></span>,
which they could appreciate better than any others could.
Pilate, then, would have been under the necessity of believing
them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on their word</span></em>. But this Roman, indignant at their proposed
course of proceeding, which would have restricted his
jurisdiction by making him the passive instrument of the
wishes of the Jews, answered them in an ironical manner:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page560">[pg 560]</span><a name="Pg560" id="Pg560" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Well, since you say he has sinned against your law, take him
yourselves and judge him according to your law. John xviii. 31.
This was an absolute mystification to them, for they knew their
own want of power to condemn him to death. But they were
obliged to yield the point, and to submit to Pilate himself their
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">articles of accusation</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now what were the grounds of this accusation? Were they
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same</span></em> which had hitherto been alleged against Jesus—the
charge of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">blasphemy</span></em>—which was the only one brought forward
by Caiaphas before the council of the Jews? Not at all;
despairing of obtaining from the Roman judge a sentence of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">death</span></em> for a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">religious</span></em> quarrel, which was of no interest to the
Romans,<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a> they suddenly changed their plan; they abandoned
their first accusation, the charge of blasphemy, and substituted
for it a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">political</span></em> accusation, an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">offence against the state</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here we have the very crisis, or essential incident, of the
passion; and that which makes the heaviest accusation of
guilt on the part of the informers against Jesus. For, being
fully bent on destroying him in any manner whatever, they no
longer exhibited themselves as the avengers of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their religion</span></em>,
which was alleged to have been outraged, or of their worship,
which it was pretended was threatened; but, ceasing to appear
as Jews, in order to affect sentiments belonging to a foreign
nation, those hypocrites held out the appearance of being concerned
for the interests of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></em>; they accused their own
countryman of an intention to restore the kingdom of Jerusalem,
to make himself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">king</span></em> of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jews</span></em>, and to make an insurrection
of the people against their conquerors. Let us hear them speak
for themselves:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“And they began to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">accuse</span></span> him, saying, We found this fellow
perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar,
saying, that he himself is Christ a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">king</span></span>.”</span> Luke xxiii. 2.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What a calumny! Jesus forbidding to give tribute to Cæsar!
when he had answered the Pharisees themselves, in presence of
the whole people, by showing them the image of Cæsar upon a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page561">[pg 561]</span><a name="Pg561" id="Pg561" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Roman piece of money, and saying, Give unto Cæsar the things
which are Cæsar's. But this accusation was one mode of interesting
Pilate in respect to his jurisdiction; for, as an imperial
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">procurator</span></span>, he was specially to superintend the collection of the
revenue. The second branch of the accusation still more directly
affected the sovereignty of the Romans: <span class="tei tei-q">“He holds himself up
for a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">king</span></span>.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The accusation having thus assumed a character purely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">political</span></em>,
Pilate thought he must pay attention to it. <span class="tei tei-q">“Then Pilate
entered into the judgment hall,”</span> (the place where justice was
administered,) and having <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">summoned Jesus to appear</span></em> before him,
he proceeds to his Examination, and says to him: <span class="tei tei-q">“Art thou the
king of the Jews?”</span> John xviii. 33.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This question, so different from those which had been addressed
to him at the house of the high priest, appears to have excited
the astonishment of Jesus; and, in his turn, he asked Pilate:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of
me?”</span> Ib. 24. In reality, Jesus was desirous of knowing, first
of all, the authors of this new accusation—Is this an accusation
brought against me by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Romans</span></em> or by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jews</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pilate replied to him—<span class="tei tei-q">“Am I a Jew? Thine own nation
and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me; what hast
thou done?”</span> Ib. 35.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All the particulars of this procedure are important; I cannot
too often repeat the remark, that in no part of the transactions
before Pilate is there any question at all respecting a previous
sentence, a judgment already passed—a judgment, the execution
of which was the only subject of consideration; it was a case of
a capital accusation; but an accusation which was then just
beginning; they were about the preliminary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interrogatories</span></em> put
to the accused, and Pilate says to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“What hast thou done?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Jesus, seeing by the explanation what was the source of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prejudging</span></em> of his case, and knowing the secret thoughts which
predominated in making the accusation, and that his enemies
wanted to arrive at the same end by an artifice, answered Pilate—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">My
kingdom is not of this world</span></em>; if my kingdom were of this
world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered
to the Jews;”</span> (we see, in fact, that Jesus had forbidden
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page562">[pg 562]</span><a name="Pg562" id="Pg562" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his people to resist) but, he added, <span class="tei tei-q">“now is my kingdom not
from hence.”</span> John xviii. 36.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This answer of Jesus is very remarkable; it became the foundation
of his religion, and the pledge of its universality, because
it detached it from the interests of all governments. It rests not
merely in assertion, in doctrine; it was given in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justification</span></em>, in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">defence</span></em> against the accusation of intending to make himself
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King of the Jews</span></span>. Indeed, if Jesus had affected a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">temporal</span></em> royal
authority, if there had been the least attempt, on his part, to
usurp <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the power of Cæsar</span></em>, he would have been guilty of treason
in the eyes of the magistrate. But, by answering twice, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">my
kingdom is not of this world</span></span>, my kingdom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">is not from hence</span></span>, his
justification was complete.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pilate, however, persisted and said to him: <span class="tei tei-q">“Art thou a king
then?”</span> Jesus replied, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this
end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I
should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the
truth heareth my voice. John xviii. 37.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pilate then said to him: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What is the truth?</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This question proves, that Pilate had not a very clear idea of
what Jesus called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the truth</span></span>. He perceived nothing in it but
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideology</span></em>; and, satisfied with having said (less in the manner of a
question than of an exclamation) <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What is the truth</span></span>,”</span> he went
on to the Jews (who remained outside) and said to them, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I
find in him no fault at all</span></span>.”</span> John xviii. 38.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here, then, we see Jesus absolved from the accusation by the
declaration of the Roman judge himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the accusers, persisting still farther, added—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He stirreth
up the people, teaching</span></span> throughout all Jewry, beginning from
Galilee to this place.”</span> Luke xxiii. 5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He stirreth up the people!”</span> This is a charge of sedition;
and for Pilate. But observe, it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by the doctrine which he
teaches</span></em>; these words comprehend the real complaint of the Jews.
To them it was equivalent to saying—He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">teaches</span></em> the people, he
instructs them, he enlightens them; he preaches <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new doctrines</span></em>
which are not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ours</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“He stirs up the people!”</span> This, in their
months signified—the people hear him willingly; the people
follow and become attached to him; for he preaches a doctrine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page563">[pg 563]</span><a name="Pg563" id="Pg563" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that is friendly and consolatory to the people; he unmasks our
pride, our avarice, our insatiable spirit of domination!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pilate, however, does not appear to have attached much importance
to this new turn given to the accusation; but he here
betrays a weakness. He heard the word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Galilee</span></span>; and he makes
that the occasion of shifting off the responsibility upon another
public officer, and seizes the occasion with avidity. He says to
Jesus—you are a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Galilean</span></span> then? and, upon the answer being in
the affirmative, considering Jesus as belonging to the jurisdiction
of Herod-Antipas, who, by the good pleasure of Cæsar, was then
tetrarch of Galilee, he sent him to Herod. Luke xxiii. 6, 7.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Herod, who, as St. Luke says, had been long desirous of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seeing Jesus</span></em> and had hoped to see some  miracle  done by him,
after satisfying an idle curiosity and putting several questions to
him, which Jesus did not deign to answer,—Herod, notwithstanding
the presence of the priests, (who had not yet gone off,
but stood there with their scribes,) and notwithstanding the pertinacity
with which they continued to accuse Jesus, perceiving
nothing but what was merely chimerical in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accusation of
being a king</span></em>, made a mockery of the affair, and sent Jesus back
to Pilate, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after having arrayed him in a gorgeous robe</span></em>, in order to
show that he thought this pretended royalty was a subject of
ridicule rather than of apprehensions. Luke xxiii. 8, &amp;c., and
De Sacy. Ib.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No person, then, was willing to condemn Jesus; neither
Herod, who only made the case a subject of mockery, nor Pilate,
who had openly declared that he found nothing criminal
in him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the hatred of the priests was not disarmed—so far from
it, that the chief priests, with a numerous train of their partisans,
returned to Pilate with a determination to force him to
a decision.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The unfortunate Pilate, reviewing his proceedings in their
presence, said to them again: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye have brought this man unto
me as one that perverteth the people—and, behold, I, having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page564">[pg 564]</span><a name="Pg564" id="Pg564" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
examined him before you, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">have found no fault in this man
touching those things whereof ye accuse him</span></span>: No, nor yet
Herod; for I sent you to him, and lo, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing worthy of death is
done unto him</span></span>. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”</span>
Luke xxiii. 14, 15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After <span class="tei tei-q">“chastising”</span> him! And was not this a piece of
cruelty, when he considered him to be innocent?<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> But this
was an act of condescension by which Pilate hoped to quiet the
rage with which he saw they were agitated.

<span class="tei tei-q">“Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged him.”</span> John
xix. 1. And, supposing that he had done enough to disarm
their fury, he exhibited him to them in that pitiable condition;
saying to them at the same time, Behold the man! <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecce homo</span></span>.
John xix. 5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, in my turn, I say, here is indeed a decree of Pilate,
and an unjust decree; but it is not the pretended decree alleged
to have been made by the Jews. It is a decision wholly different;
an unjust decision, it is true; but sufficient to avail as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a legal
bar</span></em> to any new proceedings against Jesus for the same act.
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Non bis in idem</span></span>, no man shall be put twice in jeopardy, &amp;c. is
a maxim, which has come down to us from the Romans.

Accordingly, <span class="tei tei-q">“from thenceforth Pilate sought to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">release</span></em>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It does not appear that Pilate was malignant; we see all the
efforts he had made at different times to save Jesus. But he
was a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">public officer</span></em>, and was attached to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his office</span></em>; he was
intimidated by the outcry which called in question his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fidelity to
the emperor</span></em>; he was afraid of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dismissal</span></em>: and he yielded. He
immediately reascended the judgment-seat; (Matt. xxvii. 19),
and, as new light had thus come upon him, he proceeded to
make a second decree!
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page565">[pg 565]</span><a name="Pg565" id="Pg565" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But being for a moment stopped by the voice of his own
conscience, and by the advice which his terrified wife sent to
him—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Have thou nothing to do with that just man</span></span>”</span>—(Matt.
xxvii. 19)—he made his last effort, by attempting to influence
the populace to accept of Barabbas instead of Jesus. <span class="tei tei-q">“But the
chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release
Barabbas unto them.”</span> Mark xv. 11. Barabbas! a murderer!
an assassin!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Pilate spoke to them again: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What will ye then, that I should
do with Jesus?</span></span> And they cried out, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Away with him, crucify
him</span></span>. Pilate still persisted: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shall I crucify your king?</span></span> thus
using terms of raillery, in order to disarm them. But here
showing themselves to be more truly Roman than Pilate himself,
the chief priests hypocritically answered: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">We have no king
but Cæsar.</span></span> John xix. 15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The outcry was renewed—Crucify him, crucify him! And
the clamour became more and more threatening; <span class="tei tei-q">“and the
voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.”</span> Luke
xxiii. 23.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At length Pilate, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">being desirous of pleasing the multitude</span></span>,
proceeds to speak. But can we call it a legal adjudication, a
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">judgment</span></em>, that he is about to pronounce? Is he, at the moment,
in that free state of mind which is necessary for a judge, who is
about to pass a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sentence of death</span></em>? What new witnesses, what
proofs have been brought forward to change his conviction and
opinion, which had been so energetically declared, of the innocence
of Jesus?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that
rather a tumult was made, he took water and washed his hands
before the multitude, saying, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I am innocent of the blood of this

sentence, that it should be as they required. Luke xxiii.

xxvii. 26.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Well mayest thou wash thy hands, Pilate, stained as they are
with innocent blood! Thou hast authorised the act in thy
weakness; thou art not less culpable, than if thou hadst sacrificed
him through wickedness! All generations, down to our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page566">[pg 566]</span><a name="Pg566" id="Pg566" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

in order to hold up to them the shame of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">yielding contrary to

at the foot of thy judgment-seat, where, perhaps, thou
thyself didst not sit securely! But of what importance was
that? Thy <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">duty</span></em> spoke out; and in such a case, better would
it be to suffer death, than to inflict it on another.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We will now come to a conclusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proof</span></em> that Jesus was not, as Mr. Salvador maintains,
put to death for the crime of blasphemy or sacrilege, and for
having preached a new religious worship in contravention of
the Mosaic law, results from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the very sentence</span></em> pronounced by
Pilate; a sentence, in pursuance of which he was led to execution
by Roman soldiers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was among the Romans a custom, which we borrowed
from their jurisprudence, and which is still followed, of placing
over the head of a condemned criminal a writing containing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an
extract from his sentence</span></em>, in order that the public might know
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for what crime</span></em> he was condemned. This was the reason why
Pilate put on the cross a label, on which he had written these
words: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judæorum</span></span>, (Jesus of Nazareth,
King of the Jews), which has since been denoted by the initials
J. N. R. J. This was the alleged cause of his condemnation.
St. Mark says—<span class="tei tei-q">“And the superscription of his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accusation</span></em> was
written over—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The King of the Jews</span></span>.”</span> Mark xv. 26.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This inscription was first in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></span>, which was the legal language
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman</span></span> judge; and it was repeated in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hebrew</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page567">[pg 567]</span><a name="Pg567" id="Pg567" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Greek</span></span>, in order to be understood by the people of the nation and
by foreigners.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The chief priests, whose indefatigable hatred did not overlook
the most minute details, being apprehensive that people would
take it to be literally a fact affirmed, that Jesus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was the King of
the Jews</span></span>, said to Pilate: <span class="tei tei-q">“Write not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King of the Jews</span></span>, but that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he said</span></span> I am king of the Jews.”</span> But Pilate answered: <span class="tei tei-q">“What I
have written I have written.”</span> John xix. 21, 22.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is a conclusive answer to one of the last assertions of Mr.
Salvador, (p. 88,) that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Roman Pilate signed the sentence;”</span>
by which he always means that Pilate did nothing but sign a
sentence, which he supposes to have been passed by the Sanhedrim;
but in this he is mistaken. Pilate did not merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sign</span></em>
the sentence, or decree, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">drew it up</span></em>; and, when his draft was
objected to by the priests, he still adhered to it, saying, what I
have written shall remain as written.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here then we see the true cause of the condemnation of
Jesus! Here we have the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">judicial and legal proof</span></span>.”</span> Jesus
was the victim of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">political</span></em> accusation! He was put to death
for the imaginary crime of having aimed at the power of Cæsar,
by calling himself <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">King of the Jews</span></span>! Absurd accusation; which
Pilate never believed, and which the chief priests and the Pharisees
themselves did not believe. For they were not authorized
to arrest Jesus on that account; it was a new, and totally different,
accusation from that which they first planned—a sudden
accusation of the moment, when they saw that Pilate was but
little affected by their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">religious</span></em> zeal, and they found it necessary
to arouse <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his zeal for</span></em> Cæsar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">If thou let this man go, thou art not Cæsar's friend!</span></span>”</span> This
alarming language has too often, since that time, reverberated
in the ears of timid judges, who, like Pilate, have rendered themselves
criminal by delivering up victims through want of firmness,
whom they would never have condemned, if they had
listened to the voice of their own consciences.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us now recapitulate the case, as I have considered it from
the beginning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is it not evident, contrary to the conclusion of Mr. Salvador,
that Jesus, considered merely as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a simple citizen</span></em>, was not tried and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page568">[pg 568]</span><a name="Pg568" id="Pg568" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sentenced either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">according to law</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agreeably to the forms of
legal proceedings then existing</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God, according to his eternal design, might permit the just to
suffer by the malice of men; but he also intended, that this
should at least happen by a disregard of all laws, and by a violation
of all established rules, in order that the entire contempt of
forms should stand as the first warning of the violation of law.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us not be surprised then, that in another part of his work,
Mr. Salvador (who, it is gratifying to observe, discusses his subject
dispassionately) expresses some regret in speaking of the
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">unfortunate sentence against Jesus</span></span>.”</span> Vol. i. p. 59. He has
wished to excuse the Hebrews; but, one of that nation, in
giving utterance to the feelings of his heart, still says—in language
which I took from his own mouth, <span class="tei tei-q">“We should be very
cautious of condemning him at this day.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I pass over the excesses which followed the order of Pilate;
as, the violence shown to Simon, the Cyrenian, who was made
in some degree a sharer in the punishment, by being compelled
to carry the cross; the injurious treatment which attended the
victim to the place of the sacrifice, and even to the cross, where
Jesus still prayed for his brethren and his executioners!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To the heathen themselves I would say—You, who have gloried
in the death of Socrates, how much must you be struck with
wonder at that of Jesus! Ye, censors of the Areopagus, how
could you undertake to excuse the Synagogue, and justify the
sentence of the Hall of Judgment? Philosophy herself has not
hesitated to proclaim, and we may repeat with her—<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, if the
life and death of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Socrates</span></span> were those of a sage, the life and death
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jesus</span></span> were those of a divinity.”</span>

Christian Revelation, chapter iii. The following extract from his observations will
not be unacceptable to the reader. <span class="tei tei-q">“In other cases, when we compare the narratives of contemporary historians, it is not expected that all the circumstances alluded
to by one will be taken notice of by the rest; and it often happens that an event or
a custom is admitted upon the faith of a single historian; and the silence of all
other writers is not suffered to attach suspicion or discredit to his testimony. It is
an allowed principle, that a scrupulous resemblance betwixt two histories is very
far from necessary to their being held consistent with one another. And what is
more, it sometimes happens that, with contemporary historians, there may be an
apparent contradiction, and the credit of both parties remain as entire and unsuspicious
as before. Posterity is, in these cases, disposed to make the most
liberal allowances. Instead of calling it a contradiction, they often call it a
difficulty. They are sensible that, in many instances a seeming variety of statement
has, upon a more extensive knowledge of ancient history, admitted of a perfect
reconciliation. Instead, then, of referring the difficulty in question to the inaccuracy
or bad faith of any of the parties, they, with more justness and more
modesty, refer it to their own ignorance, and to that obscurity which necessarily
hangs over the history of every remote age. These principles are suffered to have
great influence in every secular investigation; but so soon as, instead of a secular, it
becomes a sacred investigation, every ordinary principle is abandoned, and the
suspicion annexed to the teachers of religion is carried to the dereliction of all that
candour and liberality with which every other document of antiquity is judged of
and appreciated. How does it happen that the authority of Josephus should be
acquiesced in as a first principle, while every step, in the narrative of the evangelists,
must have foreign testimony to confirm and support it? How comes it, that the
silence of Josephus should be construed into an impeachment of the testimony of
the evangelists, while it is never admitted, for a single moment, that the silence of
the evangelists can impart the slightest blemish to the testimony of Josephus?
How comes it, that the supposition of two Philips in one family should throw a
damp of scepticism over the Gospel narrative, while the only circumstance which
renders that supposition necessary is the single testimony of Josephus; in which
very testimony it is necessarily implied that there are two Herods in that same
family? How comes it, that the evangelists, with as much internal, and a vast
deal more of external evidence in their favour, should be made to stand before
Josephus, like so many prisoners at the bar of justice? In any other case, we are
convinced that this would be looked upon as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rough handling</span></em>. But we are not sorry
for it. It has given more triumph and confidence to the argument. And it is no
small addition to our faith, that its first teachers have survived an examination,
which, in point of rigour and severity, we believe to be quite unexampled in the
annals of criticism.”</span> See Chalmers's Evidences, pp. 72-74.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_52" name="note_52" href="#noteref_52">52.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">See 1 Stark.

Toulouse, who though not himself a party to the transaction, is supposed to have

is mentioned by Sully. After the battle of Aumale, in which Henry IV.
was wounded, when the officers were around the king's bed, conversing upon the
events of the day, there were not two who agreed in the recital of the most particular
circumstances of the action. D'Aubigné, a contemporary writer, does not even
mention the king's wound, though it was the only one he ever received in his life.

case, given by the reporters of legal judgments than are shown among the evangelists;
and yet we do not consider them as detracting from the credit of the reporters,
to whom we still resort with confidence, as to good authority. Some of
these discrepancies seem utterly irreconcilable. Thus, in a case, 45 Edw. III. 19,
where the question was upon a gift of lands to J. de C. with Joan, the sister of the
donor, and to their heirs, Fitzherbert (tit. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tail</span></span>, 14) says it was adjudged fee simple,
and not frankmarriage; Statham (tit. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tail</span></span>) says it was adjudged a gift in frankmarriage;
while Brook (tit. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Frankmarriage</span></span>) says it was not decided. (Vid. 10 Co.
118.) Others are irreconcilable, until the aid of a third reporter is invoked. Thus,
in the case of Cooper v. Franklin, Croke says it was not decided, but adjourned; (Cro.
Jac. 100); Godbolt says it was decided in a certain way, which he mentions;
(Godb. 269); Moor also reports it as decided, but gives a different account of the
question raised; (Moor, 848); while Bulstrode gives a still different report of the
judgment of the court, which he says was delivered by Croke himself. But by his
account it further appears, that the case was previously twice argued; and thus it
at length results that the other reporters relate only what fell from the court on
each of the previous occasions. Other similar examples may be found in 1 Dougl.
6, n. compared with 5 East, 475, n. in the case of Galbraith <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v</span></span>. Neville; and in that

Hardwicke. (See 3 Barnw. &amp; Ald. 247, 248.) Indeed, the books abound in such
instances. Other discrepancies are found in the names of the same litigating parties,
as differently given by reporters; such as, Putt <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v</span></span>. Roster, (2 Mod. 318); Foot <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v</span></span>.

even when they are not precisely within the rule of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">idem sonans</span></span>. These diversities,
it is well known, have never detracted in the slightest degree from the estimation in
which the reporters are all deservedly held, as authors of merit, enjoying, to this
day, the confidence of the profession. Admitting now, for the sake of argument,
(what is not conceded in fact,) that diversities equally great exist among the sacred
writers; how can we consistently, and as lawyers, raise any serious objection against
them on that account, or treat them in any manner different from that which we
observe towards our own reporters?</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_59" name="note_59" href="#noteref_59">59.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Hume's argument is thus refuted by Lord Brougham. <span class="tei tei-q">“Here are two
answers, to which the doctrine proposed by Mr. Hume is exposed, and either
appears sufficient to shake it.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em>—Our belief in the uniformity of the laws of nature rests not altogether
upon our own experience. We believe no man ever was raised from the dead,—not
merely because we ourselves never saw it, for indeed that would be a very
limited ground of deduction; and our belief was fixed on the subject long before
we had any considerable experience,—fixed chiefly by authority,—that is, by
deference to other men's experience. We found our confident belief in this
negative position partly, perhaps chiefly, upon the testimony of others; and at all
events, our belief that in times before our own the same position held good, must
of necessity be drawn from our trusting relations of other men—that is, it
depends upon the evidence of testimony. If, then, the existence of the law of
nature is proved, in great part at least, by such evidence, can we wholly reject the
like evidence when it comes to prove an exception to the rule—a deviation from
the law? The more numerous are the cases of the law being kept—the more
rare those of its being broken—the more scrupulous certainly ought we to be in
admitting the proofs of the breach. But that testimony is capable of making good
the proof there seems no doubt. In truth, the degree of excellence and of strength
to which testimony may arise seems almost indefinite. There is hardly any
cogency which it is not capable by possible supposition of attaining. The endless
multiplication of witnesses,—the unbounded variety of their habits of thinking,
their prejudices, their interests,—afford the means of conceiving the force of their
testimony, augmented <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad infinitum</span></span>, because these circumstances afford the means
of diminishing indefinitely the chances of their being mistaken, all misled, or all
combining to deceive us. Let any man try to calculate the chances of a thousand
persons who come from different quarters, and never saw each other before,
and who all vary in their habits, stations, opinions, interests,—being mistaken or
combining to deceive us, when they give the same account of an event as
having happened before their eyes,—these chances are many hundreds of thousands
to one. And yet we can conceive them multiplied indefinitely; for one hundred
thousand such witnesses may in all like manner bear the same testimony; and they
may all tell us their story within twenty-four hours after the transaction, and in the
next parish. And yet, according to Mr. Hume's argument, we are bound to disbelieve
them all, because they speak to a thing contrary to our own experience, and
to the accounts which other witnesses had formerly given us of the law of nature,
and which our forefathers had handed down to us as derived from witnesses who
lived in the old time before them. It is unnecessary to add that no testimony of
the witnesses, whom we are supposing to concur in their relation, contradicts any
testimony of our own senses. If it did, the argument would resemble Archbishop
Tillotson's upon the Real Presence, and our disbelief would be at once warranted.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Secondly</span></em>—This leads us to the next objection to which Mr. Hume's argument is
liable, and which we have in part anticipated while illustrating the first. He
requires us to withhold our belief in circumstances which would force every man of
common understanding to lend his assent, and to act upon the supposition of the
story told being true. For, suppose either such numbers of various witnesses as
we have spoken of; or, what is perhaps stronger, suppose a miracle reported to us,
first by a number of relators, and then by three or four of the very soundest judges
and most incorruptibly honest men we know,—men noted for their difficult belief of
wonders, and, above all, steady unbelievers in miracles, without any bias in favour
of religion, but rather accustomed to doubt, if not disbelieve,—most people would
lend an easy belief to any miracles thus vouched. But let us add this circumstance,
that a friend on his death-bed had been attended by us, and that we had told him a
fact known only to ourselves,—something that we had secretly done the very
moment before we told it to the dying man, and which to no other being we had
ever revealed,—and that the credible witnesses we are supposing, informed us that
the deceased appeared to them, conversed with them, remained with them a day or
two, accompanying them, and to avouch the fact of his reappearance on this earth,
communicated to them the secret of which we had made him the sole depository
the moment before his death;—according to Mr. Hume, we are bound rather to
believe, not only that those credible witnesses deceive us, or that those sound and
unprejudiced men were themselves deceived, and fancied things without real
existence, but further, that they all hit by chance upon the discovery of a real
secret, known only to ourselves and the dead man. Mr. Hume's argument requires
us to believe this as the lesser improbability of the two—as less unlikely than the
rising of one from the dead; and yet every one must feel convinced, that were he
placed in the situation we have been figuring, he would not only lend his belief to
the relation, but if the relators accompanied it with a special warning from the
deceased person to avoid a certain contemplated act, he would, acting upon the
belief of their story, take the warning, and avoid doing the forbidden deed. Mr.
Hume's argument makes no exception. This is its scope; and whether he chooses
to push it thus far or no, all miracles are of necessity denied by it, without the
least regard to the kind or the quantity of the proof on which they are rested; and
the testimony which we have supposed, accompanied by the test or check we have
supposed, would fall within the grasp of the argument just as much and as clearly
as any other miracle avouched by more ordinary combinations of evidence.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The use of Mr. Hume's argument is this, and it is an important and a valuable
one. It teaches us to sift closely and rigorously the evidence for miraculous
events. It bids us remember that the probabilities are always, and must always be
incomparably greater against, than for, the truth of these relations, because it is
always far more likely that the testimony should be mistaken or false, than that
the general laws of nature should be suspended. Further than this the doctrine
cannot in soundness of reason be carried. It does not go the length of proving
that those general laws cannot, by the force of human testimony, be shown to have
been, in a particular instance, and with a particular purpose, suspended.”</span> See his
Discourse of Natural Theology, Note 5, p. 210-214. (Ed. 1835.)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Laplace, in his Essai sur les Probabilités, maintains that, the more extraordinary
the fact attested, the greater the probability of error or falsehood in the
attestor. Simple good sense, he says, suggests this; and the calculation of probabilities
confirms its suggestion. There are some things, he adds, so extraordinary,
that nothing can balance their improbability. The position here laid down is, that
the probability of error, or of the falsehood of testimony, becomes in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proportion</span></em>
greater, as the fact which is attested is more extraordinary. And hence a fact
extraordinary in the highest possible degree, becomes in the highest possible degree
improbable; or so much so, that nothing can counterbalance its improbability.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This argument has been made much use of, to discredit the evidence of miracles,
and the truth of that divine religion which is attested by them. But however
sound it may be, in one sense, this application of it is fallacious. The fallacy lies
in the meaning affixed to the term <span class="tei tei-q">“extraordinary.”</span> If Laplace means a fact
extraordinary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">under</span></em> its existing circumstances and relations, that is, a fact remaining
extraordinary, notwithstanding all its circumstances, the position need not
here to be controverted. But if the term means extraordinary <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the abstract</span></em>,
it is far from being universally true, or affording a correct test of truth, or rule
of evidence. Thus, it is extraordinary that a man should leap fifteen feet at a
bound; but not extraordinary that a strong and active man should do it, under a
sudden impulse to save his life. The former is improbable in the abstract; the
latter is rendered probable by the circumstances. So, things extraordinary, and
therefore improbable under one hypothesis, become the reverse under another.
Thus, the occurrence of a violent storm at sea, and the utterance by Jesus of the
the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace, be still,”</span> succeeded instantly by a perfect calm, are facts which,
taken separately from each other, are not in themselves extraordinary. The connexion
between the command of Jesus and the ensuing calm, as cause and effect,
would be extraordinary and improbable if he were a mere man; but it becomes
perfectly natural and probable, when his divine power is considered. Each of those
facts is in its nature so simple and obvious, that the most ignorant person is capable
of observing it. There is nothing extraordinary in the facts themselves; and the
extraordinary coincidence, in which the miracle consists, becomes both intelligible
and probable upon the hypothesis of the Christian. (See the Christian Observer for
Oct. 1838, p. 617.) The theory of Laplace may, with the same propriety, be
applied to the creation of the world. That matter was created out of nothing is
extremely improbable, in the abstract, that is, if there is no God; and therefore
it is not to be believed. But if the existence of a Supreme Being is conceded, the
fact is perfectly credible.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Laplace was so fascinated with his theory, that he thought the calculus of probabilities
might be usefully employed in discovering the value of the different
methods resorted to, in those sciences which are in a great measure conjectural, as
medicine, agriculture, and political economy. And he proposed that there should be
kept, in every branch of the administration, an exact register of the trials made of
different measures, and of the results, whether good or bad, to which they have led.
(See the Edinburgh Review, vol. xxiii. pp 335, 336.) Napoleon, who appointed
him Minister of the Interior, has thus described him: <span class="tei tei-q">“A geometrician of the
first class, he did not reach mediocrity as a statesman. He never viewed any
subject in its true light; he was always occupied with subtleties; his notions were
all problematic; and he carried into the administration the spirit of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">infinitely</span></em>
small.”</span> See the Encyclopedia Britannica, art. Laplace, vol. xiii. p. 101. Memoires
Ecrits à Ste. Helena, i. 3. The injurious effect of deductive reasoning, upon the
minds of those who addict themselves to this method alone, to the exclusion of all
other modes of arriving at the knowledge of truth in fact, is shown with great clearness

Josephus, who relates, (Ant. b. 17, ch. 9, § 3,) an instance of savage cruelty in Archelaus,
immediately on his coming to the throne, in causing three thousand persons to be
butchered in cold blood, at the first passover after Herod's death. Such an act, committed
under such circumstances, must have been rapidly made known abroad, and inspired all
persons with horror. Well, therefore, might Joseph fear to return. But Matthew's
incidental allusion to the cause, is characteristic of a man intent only upon the statement

Jewish children were not obliged to the observances
of the ceremonial law, until they attained to years of discretion, which, in males, was
fixed by common consent at twelve years. On arriving at this age, they were taken to
Jerusalem at the passover, of which they thenceforth participated, as <span class="tei tei-q">“sons of commandment,”</span>
being fully initiated into the doctrines and ceremonies of the Jewish church,
probably after examination by the doctors. This accounts for the circumstance of his

This account of their manner of travelling furnishes a ready answer to the question,
How could Joseph and Mary make a day's journey, without discovering, before night,
that Jesus was not in the company? In the day-time, we may reasonably presume,
the travellers would mingle with different parties of their friends and acquaintance; but
in the evening, when they were about to encamp, every one would join the family to
which he belonged. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Campbell</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in loc</span></span>.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_101" name="note_101" href="#noteref_101">101.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Genealogy of Jesus, as given by Luke, is here inverted for the sake of

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“1. There is some diversity among commentators in making out the three divisions,
each of fourteen generations, v. 17. It is, however, obvious, that the first division begins
with Abraham and ends with David. But does the second begin with David, or with
Solomon? Assuredly with the former; because, just as the first begins <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">apo Abraham</span></span>,
so the second also is said to begin <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">apo David</span></span>. The first
extends <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">heos David</span></span>, and
includes him; the second extends to an epoch and not to a person; and therefore the
persons who are mentioned as coeval with this epoch are not reckoned before it. After
the epoch the enumeration begins again with Jechoniah, and ends with Jesus. In this
way the three divisions are made out thus:—</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Abraham.<br />
2. Isaac.<br />

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“2. Another difficulty arises from the fact, that between Joram and Ozias, in v. 8,
three names of Jewish kings are omitted, viz. Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah; see 2 K.
8, 25 and Chr. 22, 1. 2 K. 11, 2. 21 and 2 Chr. 22, 11. 2 K. 12, 21. 14, 1 and 2 Chr.
24, 27. Further, between Josiah and Jechoniah in v. 11, the name of Jehoiakim is also
omitted; 2 K. 23, 34. 2 Chr. 36, 4. comp. 1 Chr. 3, 15, 16. If these four names are to
be reckoned, then the second division, instead of fourteen generations, will contain
eighteen, in contradiction to v. 17. To avoid this difficulty, Newcome and some others
have regarded v. 17 as a mere gloss, <span class="tei tei-q">‘a marginal note taken into the text.’</span> This indeed
is in itself possible; yet all the external testimony of manuscripts and versions is in
favour of the genuineness of that verse. It is better therefore to regard these names as
having been customarily omitted in the current genealogical tables, from which Matthew
copied. Such omissions of particular generations did sometimes actually occur, <span class="tei tei-q">‘propteres
quod malæ essent et impiæ,’</span> according to R. Sal. Jarchi; Lightfoot, Hor. Heb. in Matth.
1, 8. A striking example of an omission of this kind, apparently without any such reason,
is found in Ezra 7, 1-5, compared with 1 Chr. 6, 3-15. This latter passage contains
the lineal descent of the high-priests from Aaron to the captivity; while Ezra, in the place
cited, in tracing back his own genealogy through the very same line of descent, omits at
least six generations. A similar omission is necessarily implied in the genealogy of David,
as given Ruth 4, 20-22. 1 Chr. 2, 10-12. Matth. 1, 5, 6. Salmon was contemporary
with the capture of Jericho by Joshua, and married Rahab. But from that time until
David, an interval of at least four hundred and fifty years (Acts 13, 20,) there intervened,
according to the list, only four generations, averaging of course more than one hundred
years to each. But the highest average in point of fact is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> generations to a century;
and if reckoned by the eldest sons they are usually shorter, or three generations for every
seventy-five or eighty years. See Sir I. Newton's Chronol. p. 53. Lond. 1728.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We may therefore rest in the necessary conclusion, that as our Lord's regular descent
from David was always asserted, and was never denied even by the Jews; so Matthew, in
tracing this admitted descent, appealed to genealogical tables, which were public and
acknowledged in the family and tribe from which Christ sprang. He could not indeed do
otherwise. How much stress was laid by the Jews upon lineage in general, and how much
care and attention were bestowed upon such tables, is well known. See Lightfoot, Hor.
Heb. in Matth. 1, 1. Comp. Phil. 3, 4, 5.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“II. Other questions of some difficulty present themselves, when we compare together
the two genealogies.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“1. Both tables at first view purport to give the lineage of our Lord through Joseph.
But Joseph cannot have been the son by natural descent of both Joseph and Heli (Eli),
Matth. 1, 16. Luke 3, 23. Only one of the tables therefore can give his true lineage by
generation. This is done apparently in that of Matthew; because, beginning at Abraham,
it proceeds by natural descent, as we know from history, until after the exile; and then
continues on in the same mode of expression until Joseph. Here the phrase is changed;
and it is no longer Joseph who 'begat' Jesus, but Joseph <span class="tei tei-q">‘the husband of Mary, of whom
was born Jesus who is called the Christ.’</span> See Augustine, de Consensu Evangel. II. 5.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“2. To whom then does the genealogy in Luke chiefly relate? If in any way to
Joseph, as the language purports, then it must be because he in some way bore the legal
relation of son to Heli, either by adoption or by marriage. If the former simply, it is
difficult to comprehend why, along with his true personal lineage as traced by Matthew up
through the royal line of Jewish kings to David, there should be given also another
subordinate genealogy, not personally his own, and running back through a different and
inferior line to the same great ancestor. If, on the other hand, as is most probable, this
relation to Heli came by marriage with his daughter, so that Joseph was truly his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">son-in-law</span></em>
(comp. Ruth 1, 8. 11. 12); then it follows, that the genealogy in Luke is in fact that
of Mary the mother of Jesus. This being so, we can perceive a sufficient reason why this
genealogy should be thus given, viz. in order to show definitely, that Jesus was in the
most full and perfect sense a descendant of David: not only by law in the royal line of
kings, through his reputed father, but also in fact by direct personal descent through his
mother.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That Mary, like Joseph, was a descendant of David, is not indeed elsewhere expressly
said in the New Testament. Yet a very strong presumption to that effect is to be drawn
from the address of the angel in Luke 1, 32; as also from the language of Luke 2, 5,
where Joseph, as one of the posterity of David, is said to have gone up to Bethlehem, to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">enroll himself with Mary his espoused wife</span></span>. The ground and circumstances of Mary's
enrolment must obviously have been the same as in the case of Joseph himself. Whether
all this arose from her having been an only child and heiress, as some suppose, so that she
was espoused to Joseph in accordance with Num. 36, 8, 9, it is not necessary here to inquire.
See Michaelis <span class="tei tei-q">‘Commentaries on the Laws of Moses,’</span> Part II. § 78.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It is indeed objected, that it was not customary among the Jews to trace back descent
through the female line, that is, on the mother's side. There are, however, examples to
show that this was sometimes done; and in the case of Jesus, as we have seen, there was a
sufficient reason for it. Thus in 1 Chr. 2, 22, Jair is enumerated among the posterity of
Judah by regular descent. But the grandfather of Jair had married the daughter of Machir,
one of the heads of Manasseh, 1 Chr. 2, 21. 7, 14; and therefore in Num. 32, 40. 41, Jair
is called the son (descendant) of Manasseh. In like manner, in Ezra, 2, 61, and Neh. 7,
63, a certain family is spoken of as <span class="tei tei-q">‘the children of Barzillai;’</span> because their ancestor <span class="tei tei-q">‘took

<span class="tei tei-q">“3. A question is raised as to the identity, in the two genealogies, of the Salathiel and
Zorobabel named as father and son, Matth. 1, 12. Luke 3, 27. The Zorobabel of Matthew
is no doubt the chief, who led back the first band of captives from Babylon, and rebuilt the
temple, Ezra c. 2-6. He is also called the son of Salathiel in Ezra 3, 2. Neb. 12, 1.
Hagg. 1, 1. 2, 2. 23. Were then the Salathiel and Zorobabel of Luke the same persons?
Those who assume this, must rest solely on the identity of the names; for there is no
other possible evidence to prove, either that they were contemporary, or that they were not
different persons. On the other hand, there are one or two considerations, of some force,
which go to show that they were probably not the same persons.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“First, if Salathiel and Zorobabel are indeed the same in both genealogies, then Salathiel
who, according to Matthew, was the son of Jechoniah by natural descent, must have
been called the son of Neri in Luke either from adoption or marriage. In that case, his
connection with David through Nathan, as given by Luke, was not his own personal
genealogy. It is difficult, therefore, to see Luke, after tracing back the descent of
Jesus to Salathiel, should abandon the true personal lineage in the royal line of kings, and
turn aside again to a merely collateral and humbler line. If the mother of Jesus was in
fact descended from the Zorobabel and Salathiel of Matthew, she, like them, was descended
also from David through the royal line. Why rob her of this dignity, and ascribe to her
only a descent through an inferior lineage? See Spanheim Dubia Evangel. I. p. 108, sq.</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Again, the mere identity of names under these circumstances, affords no proof; for
nothing is more common even among contemporaries. Thus we have two Ezras; one in
Neh. 12, 1. 13, 33; from whom Ezra the scribe is expressly distinguished in v. 36. We
have likewise two Nehemiahs; one who went up with Zorobabel, Ezra 2, 2; and the other
the governor who went later to Jerusalem, Neh. 2, 9, sq. So too, as contemporaries, Joram
son of Ahab, king of Israel, and Joram (Jehoram,) son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah;
2 K. 8, 16, coll. v. 23, 24. Also Joash king of Judah, and Joash king of Israel; 2 K.
13, 9, 10. Further, we find in succession among the descendants of Cain the following
names: Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methusael, Lamech, Gen. 4, 17, 18; and later among the
descendants of Seth these similar ones: Enoch, Methusalah, Lamech, Gen. 5, 21-25.”</span>

Matthew relates the principal fact, the calling and the following; Luke has the accompanying

broken,—by the great draught they had taken. What is related by Luke, is not denied

the consequences of a premature full manifestation of himself as the Messiah, by
awakening the jealousy of the Roman government, might, humanly speaking, have
impeded his ministry. Yet there was great propriety in the private exhibition, to the
priesthood, of full proof that he was the Messiah; after which, their obstinacy in
rejecting him was inexcusable. In this, and divers other instances, our Lord manifested his intent not to be generally known to the Jews as their Messiah, till the consummation
of his ministry. A general announcement of his divine character at the
outset would have been productive of no good; on the contrary it would have excited
the malice of the Scribes, Pharisees and Herodians against him; would have favoured
the conceit of the Jews that he was to be their temporal king; would have awakened
the jealousy of the Roman government; and in the natural course of things, would
have prevented him from giving the many miraculous proofs which he gave of his ministry,
and thus laying solid foundations for faith in his divine mission; would have
exposed him and his religion to the charge of ostentation, vanity, and love of power
and display; and would have deprived the world of that example which he gave, of
meekness, humility and patient suffering and self-denial. According to human experience,
an early assumption of regal splendour, supported by the miracles he wrought,
would have been successful, and carried him to the throne instead of the cross; but it
would have deprived the world of the great object of his mission. A sufficient number
were enlightened to attest his miracles and proclaim his religion, and enough were left in

called Zelotes.’</span> Now if any difference was admitted in this place, we might expect it to
extend no farther than to the order of the names, or the addition of a surname; as, for
instance, Matthew calls the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Thaddeus’</span> of Mark also <span class="tei tei-q">‘Lebbeus;’</span> but here we have one
surname changed for another. It is indeed easy to conceive, that Simon might have been
commonly distinguished by either appellative, but this we can only conjecture; neither
Evangelist adds a word to explain the point. 2, The other discrepancy, however, appears
more serious. The Lebbeus or Thaddeus of St. Matthew and Mark, is entirely omitted in
the list of St. Luke, who substitutes <span class="tei tei-q">‘Judas the brother of James.’</span> Here is certainly a
marked difference, for it would not seem very probable, that the Apostle in question passed
by three distinct names. Nor could this be a mere oversight in St. Luke, for, in Acts i. 13,
where a catalogue of the eleven is inserted, he mentioned this individual in exactly the same
manner. Are we to suppose then that the Evangelist commits a deliberate error in this
particular? We have distinct and satisfactory witnesses to prove that there really was an
Apostle, besides Iscariot, who bore the name of Judas. Both Matthew (xiii. 55,) and Mark
(vi. 3,) concur in speaking of James and Jude as the near relations of Christ, and part of
this statement is incidentally confirmed by St. Paul, who calls James <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Lord's brother.’</span>
(Gal. i. 19.) But farther, St. John (xiv. 22,) presents us with a remark made by <span class="tei tei-q">‘Judas
not Iscariot;’</span> evidently one of the Apostles; and St. Jude himself, in the first verse of
his Epistle, styles himself <span class="tei tei-q">‘the brother of James.’</span> There is thus amply sufficient
evidence, that all the Gospel writers acknowledge an Apostle of this name, though St.
Matthew, with his usual simplicity, familiarly mentions him by two of his appellations,
omitting that of Judas, and St. Mark sees no occasion to depart from his language, in a
matter of such general notoriety. Luke, on the other hand, usually studious of accuracy,
distinguishes this Apostle by the name generally current in the Church, when his Gospel
was written. This variation then may, upon the whole, convince us how undesignedly
the writers of Scripture confirm each other's statements; yet can this only be the result of
a minute examination upon our part, and upon the probability of this, a cautious writer
would hardly stake his reputation for truth or exactness.”</span> See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Roberts's</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Light shining

The whole picture is striking. Jesus ascends a mountain, employs the night in prayer,
and having thus solemnly invoked the divine blessing, authoritatively separates the twelve
apostles from the mass of his disciples. He descends, and heals, in the plain, all among a
great multitude, collected from various parts by the fame of his miraculous power. Having
thus created attention, he satisfies the desire of the people to hear his doctrine; and retiring
first to the mountain whence he came, that his attentive hearers might follow him, and
might better arrange themselves before him. Sacro digna silentio Mirantur <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omnes</span></span> dicere.

The different accounts of the Sermon on the Mount may be reconciled, by considering
that Mathew wrote chiefly for the Hebrew Christians; and it was therefore important for
him to bring out, in full, the manner in which our Lord enforced the spiritual nature of
his dispensation and doctrine, in opposition to the mere letter of the Jewish law, and the
teaching and practice of Scribes and Pharisees; which he does particularly and with many
examples; while Luke, on the contrary, wrote chiefly for Gentile Christians, to whom the
contrast with the Jewish law was of less interest; and therefore he omits those parts of
the discourse, and dwells only upon those which were of practical importance to all.

ever discovered the least fault in the character or conduct of Jesus, he certainly would
have disclosed it;—he would not have publicly confessed that he had betrayed innocent
blood, and have sunk down in insupportable anguish and despair. See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Tappin's</span></span> Lect. on
Eccl. Hist. ii.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_183" name="note_183" href="#noteref_183">183.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The traditions of the elders were unwritten
ordinances of indefinite antiquity, the principal of which, as the Pharisees alleged, were
delivered to Moses in the mount, and all of which were transmitted through the High
Priests and Prophets, down to the members of the great Sanhedrim in their own times;
and from these, as the Jews say, they were handed down to Gamaliel, and ultimately to
Rabbi Jehudah, by whom they were digested and committed to writing, toward the close
of the second century. This collection is termed the Mishna; and in many cases
it is esteemed among the Jews as of higher authority than the law itself. In like manner,
there are said to be many Christians, at the present day, who receive ancient traditionary
usages and opinions as authoritative exponents of Christian doctrine. They say that the
preached gospel was before the written gospel; and that the testimony of those who heard
it is entitled to equal credit with the written evidence of the Evangelists; especially as the
latter is but a brief record, while the oral preaching was a more full and copious announcement
of the glad tidings.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These traditions, both of the Jewish and the Christian Church, seem to stand <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in pari
ratione</span></span>, the arguments in favour of the admissibility and effect of the one, applying with
the same force, in favour of the other. All these arguments may be resolved into
two grounds, namely, contemporaneous practice subsequently and uniformly continued;
and contemporaneous declarations, as part of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">res gestæ</span></span>, faithfully transmitted to
succeeding times. It is alleged that those to whom the law of God was first announced,
best knew its precise import and meaning, and that therefore their interpretation and practice,
coming down concurrently with the law itself, is equally obligatory.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this argument assumes what cannot be admitted; for it still remains to be shown
that those who first heard the law, when orally announced, had any better means
of understanding it than those to whom the same words were afterwards read. The
Ten Commandments were spoken in the hearing of Aaron and all the congregation
of Israel; immediately after which they made and worshipped a golden calf. Surely
this will not be adduced as a valid contemporaneous exposition of the second commandment.
The error of the argument lies in the nature of the subject. The human
doctrine of contemporaneous exposition is applicable only to human laws and the transactions
of men, as equals, and not to the laws of God. Among men, when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">their own</span></span>
language is doubtful and ambiguous, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">their own</span></span> practice is admissible, to expound it;
because both the language and the practice are but the outward and visible signs of the
meaning and intention of one and the same mind and will, which inward meaning and
intention is the thing sought after. It is on the same ground, that, where a statute,
capable of divers interpretations, has uniformly been acted upon in a certain way, this is
held a sufficient exposition of its true intent. In both cases it is the conduct of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the parties</span></span>
themselves which is admitted to interpret their own language; expressed, in cases of
contract, by themselves in person, and in statutes, through the medium of the legislators,
who were their agents and representatives; and in both cases, it is merely the interpretation
of what a man says, by what he does. But this rule has never been applied, in the
law, to the language of any other person than the party himself; never, to the command
or direction of his superior or employer. And even the language of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">parties</span></span>, when it
is contained in a sealed instrument, is at this day held incapable of being expounded
by their actions, on account of the greater solemnity of the instrument. See Baynham <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v</span></span>.
Guy's Hospital, 3 Vesey's Rep. 295. Eaton <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v</span></span>. Lyon, Ibid. 690, 694. The practice
of men, therefore, can be no just exponent of the law of God. If they have mistaken the
meaning of his command from the beginning, the act of contravention remains a sin in the
last transgressor, as well as the first; for the word of God cannot be changed or affected
by the gloss of human interpretation.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The other ground, namely, that the testimony of those who heard Jesus and his
apostles preach, is of equal authority with the Scriptures, being contemporaneous declarations,
and parts of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">res gestae</span></span>, and therefore admissible in aid of the exposition of
the written word, is equally inconsistent with the sound and settled rules of law respecting
writings. When a party has deliberately committed his intention and meaning to writing,
the law regards the writing as the sole repository of his mind and intention, and does not
admit any oral testimony to alter, add to, or otherwise affect it. The reasons for this rule
are two; first, because the writing is the more solemn act, by the party himself, designed
to prevent mistake, and to remain as the perpetual memorial of his intention; and,
secondly, because of the great uncertainty and weakness of any secondary evidence. For
no one can tell whether the by-standers heard precisely what was said, nor whether they
heard it all, nor whether they continued to remember it with accuracy until the time
when they wrote it down, or communicated it to those who wrote it; to say nothing of
the danger of their mixing up the language of the speaker with what was said by others,
or with their own favourite theories. And where the witnesses were not the original
auditors of what was said, no one knows how much the truth may have suffered from the
many channels through which it has passed, in coming from the first speaker to the
last write or witness. On all these accounts, the law rejects oral testimony of what the
parties said, in regard to anything that has already been solemnly committed to writing by
the parties themselves, and rejects the secondary evidence of hearsay, when evidence of a
higher degree, as, for example, a written declaration of the party, can be obtained.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, inasmuch as the writings of the Evangelists and Apostles were penned under the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit, why should not the documentary evidence of the Gospel,
thus drawn up by them, be treated with at least as much respect as other written documents?
If they were inspired to write down those great truths for a perpetual memorial to
after ages, then this record is the primary evidence of those truths. It is the word of God,
penned by his own dictation, and sealed, as it were, with his own seal. If it were a man's
word and will, thus solemnly written, no verbal or secondary evidence could be admitted,
by the common law, to explain, add to, or vary it; nothing could be engrafted upon it;
nor could any person be admitted to testify what he heard the party say, in regard to what
was written. The courts would at once reject all such attempts, and confine themselves
strictly to the writing before them, the only inquiry being as to the meaning of the
language contained in that document, and not as to what the party may elsewhere have
spoken. The law presumes that the writing alone is the source to which he intended
that resort should be had, in order to ascertain his meaning. But by calling in the
fathers, with their traditions, to prove what Christ and his Apostles taught, beyond what
is solemnly recorded in the Scriptures, the principle of this plain and sound rule of law is
violated; resort is had to secondary evidence of the truths of our religion, when the
primary evidence is already at hand; and the pure fountain is deserted for the muddy
stream.</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_184" name="note_184" href="#noteref_184">184.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Matthew was not only a Jew himself, but it is evident, from the

He had a twofold object; to call the attention of his disciples to the fact of
her being a foreigner, in order to show them that his ministry, though primarily and
chiefly to the Jews, was in truth designed for the benefit of the Gentiles also; and to
draw out, as it were, the great faith of the woman, in order to teach them the effect of
faithful and persevering supplication. To attain these objects, he took the direct and most
obvious method. In this instance also, as in those of the centurion, (Matth. viii. 5-13,)

he fully performed every part of the condition; and that in this sense, whosoever offended
in one point, or was deficient in performing any part of the condition, was guilty of all—lost

plain assertion, what Mark informs us was a reply to an inquiry made by the disciples
apart. Or, we may suppose with Le Clerc, that this assertion was first advanced to the
Pharisees, and then repeated to the disciples.

Jesus therefore may be represented, (Matt. xx. 29; Mark x. 46,) not as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">finally leaving</span></em>
Jericho for Jerusalem, but as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">occasionally going out</span></em> of Jericho; in which city he had
made some abode, it matters not for how few days. See Mark xi. 19. Jericho was a very
considerable city; and we do not read that it was visited by our Lord at any other time.
We may therefore suppose that Jesus, accompanied by his disciples and the multitude, and
intent on his great work of propagating the gospel, went out of this city, knowing that
a fit occasion of working a miracle would present itself; and that on his return, as
he drew nigh unto Jericho, (Luke xviii. 35,) he restored the blind men to sight. It is
likewise probable that Jesus, having given this proof of his divine mission, or foreseeing
that so great a miracle would create too much attention in the people, prudently and
humbly passed through Jericho on his return to it, (Luke xix. 1,) and continued his
journey to Jerusalem.

as a standing mark of distinction between them and other nations; and a trial of
prince and people, whether they had confidence in God their deliverer, who wanted
neither horses nor footmen to fight his battles. It was observed for near four hundred
years, until some time in the reign of Solomon; for David himself rode on a mule; as
did Solomon also on the day of his coronation. 1 Kings i. 33, 34. See Judges x. 4,
and xii. 14; 1 Saml. xxv. 20. Subsequently the kings of Israel and Judah violated
this command, by copying the example of the neighbouring princes in the establishment
of their cavalry. The displeasure of God for this offence is indicated by several of the
prophets: Isaiah ii. 6, 7, and xxxi. 1; Hosea xiv. 3, and i. 7; Micah v. 10, 11.—In opposition
to the character of these warlike and disobedient princes, it was predicted that
Messiah would come as a just king, having salvation;—a deliverer—riding upon an ass,

paschal supper, and the going to Gethsemane. Before the eating of the paschal lamb,
Jesus rises from supper to wash the disciples' feet. John xiii. 1, 4. While they are
eating, a declaration is made of Judas's treachery, and the bread is instituted, Matt.
xxvi. 21, 26. See also Mark. After, the cup is instituted, Luke xxii. 20; 1 Cor. xi.
25. But as to the particular and precise order of the facts and discourses during this
period, Pilkington's words relating to one of them are applicable to all. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is observable
that St. Luke mentions the institution of the communion before the declaration
of Judas's treachery; whereas the other Evangelists place these in a different
order. But it is a liberty I think very allowable in any historian, to neglect taking notice
of the exact order of all the facts, when he is only giving a general account of what was
done at a certain time. And if so, whichsoever was the true successive order, there can
be no just imputation upon any of the Evangelists for neglecting to observe it in the narration.”</span>

(<span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style="font-style: italic">diatheke</span></span>,) in a sense involving also the idea of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">covenant</span></span>, and in connexion with the
circumstances of a compact, has greatly perplexed many English readers of the Bible.
The difficulty occurs in Matt. 26, 28, and the parallel places, where our Lord employs the
word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">testament</span></span>, or last will, in connexion with the sacrificial shedding of his own blood;
a ceremony which, by means of a suitable animal, usually was adopted among the
ancients, upon the making of the most solemn engagements; and instead of which,
the mutual partaking of the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, by the contracting parties,
was substituted among Christians in later times. The same embarrassment occurs,
perhaps in a greater degree, in the exposition of several passages in the eighth and ninth
chapters of the Epistle to the Hebrews, (manifestly written by a profound lawyer, be he
Paul or Apollos), where he uses language applicable indifferently both to a covenant <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">inter
vivos</span></span> and a last will. For with us, a testament is simply a declaration of the last will of
the testator, in regard to the disposition of his property after his decease, irrespective of
any consent, or even knowledge, at the time, on the part of him to whom the estate
is given; while a covenant requires the mutual consent of both parties, as essential to its
existence. The one is simply the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ultima voluntas</span></span> of an individual, the other is the
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">aggregatio mentium</span></span> of both or all.

The solution of this difficulty belongs rather to theologians, whose province it is by no
means intended here to invade; but perhaps a reference to the laws and usages in force in
Judea in the times of our Saviour and his Apostles may furnish some aid, which a lawyer
might contribute without transgressing the limit of his profession.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is first to be observed that the municipal laws of Greece and Rome were strikingly
similar; those of Greece having been freely imported into the Roman jurisprudence.
In like manner, the similarity of the Grecian laws and usages with those extant in Asia
Minor, indicated a common origin; and thus, what Greece derived from Egypt and
the states of Asia Minor, these states, after many ages, received again as the laws of their
Roman masters. It should also be remembered that Palestine had been reduced to a
Roman province some years before the time of our Saviour; long enough, indeed, to have
become familiar with Roman laws and usages, even had they been previously unknown;
and that Paul, to whom the Epistle to the Hebrews is generally attributed, was himself a
thorough-bred lawyer, well versed in the customs of his country, whether ancient or
modern. Among those nations, the civil magistrate often exercised the functions of the
priesthood, these dignities being in some respects identical; and thus, whatever was
transacted before the magistrate, might naturally seem to partake of the character of
an act of religion. Covenants were always made with particular formalities, and to
those of graver nature, religious solemnities were often superadded. They were frequently
confirmed by an oath, the most solemn form of which was taken standing before the altar;
and whosoever swore by the altar, swore by the sacrifice thereon, and was held as firmly
bound as though he had passed between the dismembered parts of the victim. Of the
latter kind was the oath, by which God confirmed his covenant with Abraham (Gen. xv.)
when the visible light of his presence passed between the pieces which the patriarch had
divided and laid <span class="tei tei-q">“each piece one against another.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With these things in view, we may now look at some of the modes of transferring
property, practised by the nations alluded to.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the methods of alienation or sale of property by the owner, in his lifetime, was
that which in the Roman law was termed <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mancipatio</span></span>; a mode by which the vendor
conveyed property to the purchaser, each party being present, either in person or by his
agent, representative, or factor. Five witnesses were requisite, one of whom was called
<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">libripens</span></span>, or the balance-holder. This form had its origin in the sale of goods by weight,
but was gradually extended to all sales; and the practice was for the buyer to strike the
balance with a piece of money called a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">sestertius</span></span>, which was immediately paid over to the
vendor as part of the price; and hence the expression <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per æs et libram vendere</span></span>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wills or testaments were made with great solemnity. One method among the Romans,
probably common, in its principal traits, to the other nations before mentioned, was termed
the testament <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">per æs et libram</span></span>, it being effected in the form of a sale. This mode seems
to have been resorted to whenever the estate was given to a stranger, (<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">hæres extraneus</span></span>,) to
the exclusion of the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">hæres suus</span></span>, or <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarius</span></span>, or, as we should say, the heir at law; and
it was founded on the purchase of the estate by the adopted heir, who succeeded to the privileges
of the child. The forms of a sale by <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">mancipatio</span></span> were therefore scrupulously
observed; the presence and agreement of the purchaser, either in person or by his representative
or negotiator, being necessary to its validity. The reason for requiring this form
was because it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">involved a covenant</span></em> on the part of the adopted heir or legatee, by which he
became bound to pay all the debts of the testator. Having entered into this covenant, he
had the best possible title in law to the inheritance, namely, that of a purchaser for a
valuable consideration. Among the Greeks, and probably among the Romans also, this
was transacted in the presence of a magistrate, who sanctioned it by his sentence of
approval. This was the most ancient form of a will; and it does not seem to have been
abrogated until the time of Constantine.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, when our Saviour speaks of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">new testament in his blood</span></span>, or of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">blood of the
new testament</span></span>, and when Paul uses similar forms of expression may not the figure have
reference to the custom above stated? And if so, may not this custom guide us to the
true meaning of the words? Does it intimate to us that the promised inheritance was
first given to man, as it were by a testament in this ancient form, upon a covenant of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his
own perfect obedience</span></em> to every part of the law of God; that having broken this covenant,
his title became forfeited; that the inheritance was afterwards promised, in the same
manner, to every one, Jew or Gentile, upon a new covenant and condition, namely of a
true <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">faith</span></em> in Christ; a faith evinced in the fruits of a holy life; that this inheritance by a
new testament and covenant was negociated, as it were, and obtained for man by the
mediation of Jesus Christ, (<span class="tei tei-q">“the mediator of the new testament,”</span> Heb. 9. 15,) as the representative
of all who should accept it by such faith, and their surety for the performance
of its conditions; that it was purchased by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></span> obedience and solemnized by the sacrifice of
himself as the victim?

This solution is suggested with much diffidence. That it carries these passages clear of
all difficulty is not pretended. The very nature of the subject renders it difficult of illustration
by any reference to human affairs; and the embarrassment is proportionally
increased, whenever the simile is pressed beyond its principal point of resemblance.

It having been expressly mentioned by each Evangelist, that Peter would <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thrice</span></em> deny

</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peter's first denial</span></span>. Peter was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beneath</span></em>, in the hall of Caiaphas's house.
Dr. Scott, on Matth. xxvi. 3, observes that <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">aule</span></span> signifies an house, (Luke xi. 21,) and that
emphatically it signifies the king's house, or palace. But in Luke xxii. 55, it seems to
signify a spacious apartment, probably the High Priest's judgment-hall. It was the place
in which Jesus stood before the High Priest, (Luke xxii. 61,) and had an <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">atrium</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vestibulum</span></span>
at its entrance. This was an unfit place for the tribunal of the High Priest at
such an hour, (John xviii. 18.) Sir John Chardin says, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the lower Asia the day is
always hot; and in the height of summer the nights are as cold as at Paris in the
month of March.”</span> It remains therefore that we understand it of a spacious chamber, such
as Shaw mentions, Travels, 4to. pp. 207, 8.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Peter was not in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">higher</span></em> part, where Jesus stood before the High Priest; but
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em> that division of the hall, and in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lower</span></em> part, with the servants and officers.
The damsel, who kept the door, had entered into the hall when she charged Peter.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peter's second denial</span></span>. Peter, having once denied Jesus, naturally retired from the
place where his accuser was, to the vestibule of the hall, (Matt. xxvi. 71); and it was the
time of the first cock-crowing, or soon after midnight. After remaining here a short time,
perhaps near an hour, another damsel sees him, and says to those who were standing by in
the vestibule, that he was one of them. Peter, to avoid this charge, withdraws into the
hall, and stands and warms himself, (John xviii. 25.) The damsel, and those to whom she
had spoken, follow him; the communication between the places being immediate. Here
a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em> enforces the charge of the damsel, according to Luke; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">others</span></em> urge it according
to John, (though by him the plural may be used for the singular,) and Peter denies Jesus
vehemently.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Peter's third denial</span></span>. Peter was now in the hall. Observe Matt. xxvi. 75, and
Luke xxii. 62. He was also within sight of Jesus, though at such a distance from him
that Jesus could know what passed only in a supernatural way. About an hour after his
second denial, those who stood by founded a charge against him on his being a Galilean,
which, Luke says, one in particular strongly affirmed, (though here Matthew and Mark may
use the plural for the singular,) and which, according to John, was supported by one of
Malchus's relations. This occasioned a more vehement denial than before; and immediately
the cock crew the second time. The first denial may have been between our twelve and
one; and the second between our two and three. We must further observe, that Matt.
xxvi. 57, lays the scene of Peter's denials in the house of Caiaphas; whereas the transactions
of John xviii. 15-23 seem to have passed in the house of Annas. But John xviii. 24 is

the same person, which is highly probable, as they refer to the same period of time and to
a disciple of distinction, there is an evident consciousness of veracity in the Evangelist, in
making this reference to Rufus, then living among them, since he could not but have
known the particulars of the crucifixion, in which his own father was so intimately concerned.

But the same verbal exactness is not necessary in historians, whose aim is religious
instruction, as in recorders of public inscriptions. It is enough that the Evangelists agree
as to the main article, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the King of the Jews</span></span>,”</span> referred to, John xix. 21. That their
manner is to regard the sense, rather than the words, appears from many places. Compare
Matt. iii. 17, and ix. 11, and xv. 27, and xvi. 6, 9, and xix. 18, and xx. 33, and xxi. 9,
and xxvi. 39, 64, 70, and xxviii. 5, 6, with the parallel verses in this Harmony. Compare
also John xi. 40, with ver. 23, 25. One of the most solemn and awful of our Lord's discourses
is, in some parts, variously expressed. See Matt. xxvi. 28, Mark xiv. 24, Luke
xxii. 20, 1 Cor. xi. 25. Now as each of these writers has, beyond all doubt, faithfully
represented the meaning of Christ, we see that it might be truly done in different words,
or in a different form of the same words. His sentences also, sometimes admitted a difference of arrangement; for the order in which two sentences, or the several members of
the same sentence, are disposed by St. Matthew, is, in several places, inverted by St. Mark.
And with regard to his actions, though the most material parts of whatever they were going
to relate must command their attention, yet there was no such superior attraction in one
specific number and order of secondary circumstances, as could turn their thoughts absolutely
and exclusively to them. This is plain from instances to the contrary. One Evangelist
is sometimes distinct, while another is concise; and describes what the other passes over.

laid on the ground, the sufferer distended upon it, and four soldiers, two on each side, were
employed in driving four large nails through his hands and feet. For this service they had a
right to his clothes as a perquisite. See Dr. Harwood's Introd., cited in Horne's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introd</span></span>.,

is attributed to both in the concise relations of Matthew and Mark; the plural being
often used in the Gospels for the singular. This the Evangelists themselves show in
some instances. Compare Mark vii. 17, and Matt. xv. 15; Mark v. 31, and Luke viii.
45; Matt. xiv. 17, and Mark vi. 38, Luke ix. 13, John vi. 8, 9; Matt. xxvi. 8, and
Mark xiv. 4, John xii. 4; Matt. xxiv. 1, and Mark xiii. 1; Matt. xxvii. 37, and John
xix. 19; Matt. xxvii. 48, and Mark xv. 36, John xix. 29. See also Luke xxii. 67.
In the following places, the plural is used, while the sense shows that one is spoken of.
John xi. 8, Luke xx. 21, 39, and xxiv. 5, Matt. xv. 1, 12.—The Evangelists, therefore,
when from attention to brevity they avoid particularizing, often attribute to many what
is said or done by single persons; nor does any striking peculiarity in the case omitted, lead
them to deviate from their manner; for instance, the case of Judas, Matth. xxvi. 8, and
the parallel places. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Newcome</span></span></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_297" name="note_297" href="#noteref_297">297.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Ps. xxii. 1.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_298" name="note_298" href="#noteref_298">298.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Hil</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Hila</span></span> was the old Syriac for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vinegar</span></span>.

near the cross; and that they would retire from the horror of the concluding scene.

Preliminary Dissertation on the Gospels, (Vol. 2, Diss. ix. Part 2); but it is evident,
on examination, that he is discussing the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">word blasphemy</span></span>, and the propriety of
its application, taken in its more restricted sense of intentional and direct malediction
of Jehovah; and not whether the assumption of his attributes and authority was or
was not a violation of his law. That this assumption was a heinous transgression,
seems universally agreed. The question, therefore, is reduced to this—whether the
offence was properly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">termed</span></em> blasphemy. For the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">act</span></em>, by whatever name it were
called, was a capital crime. The Jewish judges of that day held it to amount to
blasphemy; and in so doing, they do not appear to have given to their law a construction
more expanded and comprehensive than has been given by judges in our
own times, to the law of treason, or of sedition.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_350" name="note_350" href="#noteref_350">350.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">This was judicially and solemnly done by the members of the Sanhedrim, rising
from their seats, when the crime was testified to. Only one witness was permitted
to repeat the words; the others simply stating that they heard the same which he
had related. The practice is thus described in the Mishna: <span class="tei tei-q">“Exactis omnibus,

brought to trial under the law in Deut. xiii. 1-11. See his Discourse on the Restoration
of the Jews, p. 19. But whether he was charged with a blasphemous
usurpation of the attributes of Deity, or with sedition, in inciting the people to serve

Chr. Thomasius, Dissertatio de injusto Pilati judicio, § 12, 60. The want of this
power was admitted by the Jews, in their reply to Pilate, when he required them to
judge Jesus according to their own law, and they replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is not lawful for us to
put any man to  death.”</span> John xviii. 31.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This point has been held in different ways by learned men. Some are of opinion
that the Sanhedrim had power to inflict death for offences touching religion, though
not for political offences; and that it was with reference to the charge of treason
that they said to Pilate what has just been cited from St. John. They say that,
though the Sanhedrim had convicted Jesus of blasphemy, yet they dared not execute
that sentence, for fear of a sedition of the people:—that they therefore craftily determined
to throw on Pilate the odium of his destruction, by accusing him of treason;
and hence, after condemning him, they consulted further, as stated in Matt. xxvii.
1, 2. Mark xv. 1, how to effect this design:—that when Pilate found no fault in
him, and directed them to take and crucify him, some replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“We have a law, and
by our law he ought to die,”</span> (John xix. 7,) to intimate to Pilate that Jesus was
guilty of death by the Jewish law also, as well as the Roman, and that therefore he
would not lose any popularity by condemning him. See Zorrius, Hist. Fisci Judaici,
ch. 2, § 2, (in Ugolini Thesaur. tom. 26, col. 1001-1003.) The same view is
taken by Deylingius, De Judæorum Jure Gladii, § 10, 11, 12, (in Ugolin. Thesaur.
tom. 29, col. 1189-1192.) But he concludes that in all capital cases, there was an
appeal from the Sanhedrim to the Prætor; and that without the approval of the
latter, the sentence of the Sanhedrim could not be executed. Ibid. § 15, col. 1196.
Molinæus understood the Jewish law in the same manner. See his Harmony of the
Gospels, note on John xviii. 31. C. Molinæi Opera, tom. 5. pp. 603, 604. But this
opinion is refuted by what is said by M. Dupin, Trial, &amp;c., § 8, and by Thomasius,
above cited.
